         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THat there is a <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> or chief Good to be enjoyed by Man, all ſorts acknowledg; Philoſophers and Divines, Ancient and Modern. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by all (as naturally as the greateſt flames and the little ſparks of Fire aſcend to their Sphere) either confuſedly, or diſtinctly; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only by ſome, and in the fruition whereof, true Happineſs conſiſteth. But what that is, all agree not. <hi>Varro</hi> out of Philoſophers, and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> out of <hi>Varro,</hi> maketh mention of two hundred eighty and eight Opinions about it. Some placing it here, others there, and have according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued their own conceits. Error in this Point is not more common than dangerous, being attended with variety of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainties; every one ſtriving to maintain, what he doth moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; whether an independing real-Good, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

Senſe and underſtanding in Act, is by union between the Faculty and the Object; the Soul is ſaid to be what it underſtandeth; if the Object be a real Good, the Soul by virtue of that union, hath an anſwerable denomination. In this, Philoſophy is an inſufficient Guide, looking only on this Life, and the felicity of the more ignoble part of Man, du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing his abode here in the Viſible World. A ſupernatural Revelation is needful. Reaſon cannot fathom, nor the light of Nature reach unto the end for which Man was made. Divinity diſcovers this, and Faith comprehends it; That Man was created for God, to be like and enjoy him. Chriſt is the Means to bring this to paſs. Man is made perfect, but mutable. He falleth, Chriſt ſteppeth in to raiſe him again. A new Covenant is eſtabliſhed, whereof Chriſt as Head, undertakes to perform Conditions. The Humane Nature muſt be united to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, in his Perſon, that Chriſt might ſuffer what Man had deſerved, and Man might receive what Chriſt merited. The Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the ground or medium of another Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby every Penitent Believer is made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Divine Nature, and of all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Chriſt's Obedience, as if they had done it in their own Perſons; as, of Adoption, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Sanctification, Glory. The End was firſt, the Reaſonable Creature thought on next, and
<pb facs="tcp:205125:3"/> the Means laſt. All which were foreſeen and ordered by an eternal Act of the firſt Cauſe; not that for this, or this after that; not the Means firſt, for the End, nor the End ſo firſt, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Means; but the End, Object, and Means together, according to the freedom and counſel of his Will; foreſeeing ſtill to preſerve an order in the means, both of Precedency, and inſtrumental Efficiency. He willed the Law and Goſpel ſhould be Preached, that Knowledg and Faith might be wrought in his; he willed Faith, that they might be juſtified; he willed Juſtification, that they might be ſanctified and glorified. He willed all theſe joyntly, that the End might be attained after all, <hi>viz.</hi> The Communication of his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, for the compleating of Man's Felicity.</p>
            <p>It is not theſe Titles therefore, can make Man happy. The line of his Life being drawn forth with ſo many uncertainties, and the height of his Power laid on ſo weak a foundation. At one time or other, of the beſt it may be ſaid, and the greateſt on Earth may ſay of himſelf, <hi>I was all things, and yet nothing,</hi> part of the Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> his Speech to his Council and Captains at <hi>York,</hi> where ſhortly after he died; leaving behind him this Teſtimony, as many others have have done, That Man's chiefeſt Good is not here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The Earth in her moſt glittering furniture is but Earth, Fabulous and Enthuſiaſtick, and can afford but brittle Happineſs. Honour, Riches, Pleaſure, are but deceitful Toys: So far from being Man's happineſs, that they often prove greater
<pb facs="tcp:205125:4"/> letts than helps towards Happineſs. Our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good is <hi>Bonum immobile &amp; immutabile:</hi> but Riches make themſelves Wings, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; like the Swallow in Winter ſeaſon, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly bidding farewel, never perhaps returning again; as a word once ſpoken, <hi>neſcit vox miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa reverti.</hi> Our chief Good is <hi>Bonum aeternum &amp; perfectum;</hi> while Carnal Pleaſures, even the deepeſt here, are moſt empty, frothy, and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany; like Comets made fat with ſmoaks and vapours of the Earth, and in ſtead of giving Light and Brightneſs, they bring forth Murders and Contagions. Our chief Good is <hi>Bonum Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortale;</hi> firm and ever flouriſhing, always the ſame; but Honour is fading, and often buried in the Duſt, or quickly ſwallowed up in Oblivion. Man was happy by Creation, while the prime faculties of the Soul had that bliſsful Object to reflect upon the true God <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>THis, with the reſt of the Chapter, is no <hi>National</hi> Hiſtory, limited to the <hi>Body,</hi> as ſome temporal Felicity, conveyed in a Promiſe to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Prophecy, extended to the <hi>Soul,</hi> diſcovering the means, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring everlaſting Beatitude to the Church, as under Grace. True it is, and from the Letter of the Text we may gather, that God was good and bountiful to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but ungrateful <hi>Iſrael</hi> abuſed God's bounty. [As the fed <hi>Hawk</hi> forgets his Maſter, and as the Full Moon gets fartheſt from the Sun; ſo they forgat God, and wickedly departed from him; like ill Grounds, they caſt up Thorns where Roſes were planted; they printed the ſteps of Sin upon Divine Clemency]. Which moved the Lord to deprive her of his Bleſſings, and to ſend her into Captivity, by abſence to learn
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205125:6"/> the worth of his Preſence, and to take good leave and leiſure to bewail her own Folly. [What can he do leſs than forget them, ſo they may remember him?] Where being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and diſconſolate, as a mourning Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, bereft of Friends, and means to relieve her, ſhe returns upon her ſelf, and complains unto God, who ſaw her Tears, heard her Cries, and brought her from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> turned all her ſighing into ſinging, and made her rejoice on that Bed which had ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Tears, and made to ſwim again, like <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 6.6. Repentance can turn Croſſes into Comforts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and like the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone, make Golden Afflictions. But all this was for a further intent and purpoſe, even to ſet forth their Sin, ſpiritual Bondage, and the manner of Converſion. Under that, this was meant. And ſo the words are to be taken with the beſt Interpreters of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of God's dealing in the diſpenſation of his Grace to all in Covenant with him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ordinary Method</hi> which he obſerveth in beſtowing Grace upon Men converted after actual Sins, is here fully diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>

                     <p>He turns a Wilderneſs into a River. As in ſeveral Changes in the World, Stars fall from the Firmament, to be changed into Dunghils; ſo here, the Dunghils of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mount up

So much he promiſeth to do; and it is uſual with him to advance them higheſt in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who have been leaſt eſteemed in the World. <hi>Not many wiſe Men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble; but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World to confound the wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26, 27. Chriſt's Diſciples were not fetch'd from among the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquerors; no <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> or high noble Blood of the Earth gave denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Pedigree; neither took they their Riſe from among the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins.</hi> They were not ſeaſoned with <hi>Athenian</hi> Eloquence, nor beautified with any gay and ſplendid matters of this World. They were obſcured with Poverty, and ſhadowed with meanneſs, in reſpect of Name and Gifts, of a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Trade, even <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> called from catching of Fiſh, to lay out for Souls. The Lord cutteth out his <hi>Mercuries</hi> of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely pieces of Timber, he will have his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built of rough and unpoliſh'd Stones. When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was in ſuch miſery, that ſhe could not help her ſelf, no more than a poor Infant, and for others they would not, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5. <hi>No eye pitied her,</hi> to do any thing for her, or to have any compaſſion upon her; <hi>Then I paſſed by</hi> (ſaith the Lord,) <hi>and looked upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. Lo here, Heaven ſmiled upon Hell! An old broken Inſtrument is tuned, and made melodious; tho it be the ſame
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205125:9"/> String, yet it is quite otherwiſe tuned. <hi>Hath not God choſen the Poor of this World?</hi> Jam. 2.5. He hides Treaſure under the Bark and Mantle of mean Perſons, baſe and abject in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The loſt Sheep, and ſick Men, as they have moſt need, both in truth, and in their own apprehenſion, ſo have they moſt benefit by the Phyſician. Did not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tell the Prieſts and Elders among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that notwithſtanding all their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Ceremonies, Publicans and Harlots would believe ſooner, and <hi>enter the Kingdom of Heaven before them?</hi> Mat. 21.31. And that <hi>many ſhould come from the Eaſt and Weſt, to ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> when the <hi>Children of the Kingdom</hi> (who had ſo good conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if out of danger,) <hi>ſhould be caſt into utter Darkneſs?</hi> Manaſſes <hi>did evil in the ſight of the Lord, like the abominations of the Heathen; he built the high Places and ſtrange Altars, he obſerved Times,</hi> 2 Chron. 33.3, 4, 5, 6. Yet the Lord brought him home at length through this <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> into <hi>Canaan. Mary Magdalen</hi> was a None-ſuch of uncleanneſs, ſhe was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with ſeven Devils; yet Chriſt caſt them out, and of a Den of Devils made her a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the Holy Spirit to dwell in. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, mounted in his way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> to hale the poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to Priſon; but the Lord had choſen him, and now changes the <hi>Serpent</hi> into a <hi>white
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205125:9"/> Rod.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was greatly infected with the Sin of his Country, which was as conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for Chaſtity, as the North Wind for Plants; for a great Writer, ſpeaking of <hi>Afric,</hi> ſaith it was a <hi>Country of Loves,</hi> and that it was as ſtrange a Man ſhould be an <hi>African,</hi> and not be an <hi>African;</hi> as to be an <hi>African,</hi> and not to be <hi>laſcivious.</hi> He had a Soul as it were of Sulphur, ſo much was it diſpoſed to take fire, that he haſtened to throw himſelf into the midſt of Flames. In ſhort, he fell into the Snares he deſired, and was involved in wonderful Labyrinths, where the end of one ſinful Paſſion was the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But behold here an admirable ſport of Providence, way-laying and contriving the Salvation of this great Soul, who became a rare Spectacle, and worthy the conſideration of noble Spirits; for of an earthen Pot he is made a Veſſel of Gold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luther</hi> (in whoſe Converſion the Divine Power was moſt reſplendent) of a mad Monk, as he called himſelf, was made a zealous Proteſtant. <hi>Baſilides</hi> was ſometimes a cruel Executioner of Chriſtians, that afterwards was called, and died for the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aretius</hi> ſpeaks of a certain Man in his time, (it is no feigned Story, ſaith he, for I ſaw the Man with my own eyes) who was a vile deſperate Sinner, a Drunkard, Swearer, wanton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo continued for many
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205125:10"/> years; but at length God brought him into the Wilderneſs, where he laid down the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery Crowns which he bare on his Head, his Drunkenneſs, and unthrifty Riots, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled with zeal to God, lived holily, and died comfortably.</p>
                     <p>Not to mention others, who converted from a diſſolute, prophane Converſation, found Mercy, and became eminent Inſtruments in the Church of God. Few experienced Chriſtians, <hi>Divines</hi> eſpecially, but can add Inſtances of their own Obſervation, how ſtrangely the Lord hath turned Men from Wantonneſs to Chaſtity, from Drunkenneſs to Sobriety, from common Swearing to fear an Oath; even then when they were running in a violent and deligthful motion towards Hell.</p>
                     <p>Now, why the Lord ſuffers his own to run out ſo far before he reclaim them, we may with reverence and ſubmiſſion conceive it is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> for the declaration of his own Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both in regard of his wonderful Power, and abſolute Freedom.</p>
                     <p>Of his <hi>Power,</hi> effecting this in ſome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ordinary means, as he dealt with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> in others by weak and unlikely means, as by the Miniſtry of poor Fiſher-men, preaching the Croſs: [The great God out of ſmall Acorns brings up huge Oaks, and uſually hangs great weights on little Wires, whereby he ſets out to the view of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:205125:10"/> all the ſplendor of his Omnipotent Agency.] And in a third ſort, he doth it againſt all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means; as when he occaſions Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by ſome Sin, Affliction, or Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as the curious Alchymiſt doth by his Skill extract Gold and Silver out of baſer Metals; and as the wiſe Phyſician correcteth poyſonful Ingredients, and maketh them Medicinal.</p>
                     <p>And as of his <hi>Power,</hi> ſo of his <hi>abſolute Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to do what he will with his own, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing his Grace, both when, to whom, and how he will; paſſing by the Great, Rich, Learned, (Stars of the firſt magnitude, or the greateſt Letters of the Alphabet,) and civil Formaliſts of the World, to pitch on poor, mean, and ignorant Wretches. Where Sin hath abounded, Grace doth ſuper-abound. <hi>Surgunt indocti, &amp; rapiunt Coelum</hi> &amp;c as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ſpeaks; the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence</hi> from the poor loſt Sheep; while others puffed up with their conceited Riches, of Knowledg and Holineſs, dreaming of Self-ſufficiency, are kept out, and thruſt down into Hell. If he ſhould do otherwiſe, and call on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe, in whoſe Policy and Life could be ſeen ſome outward Goodneſs to ſhine forth, Men would believe what ſome cannot forbear to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is the work of Men that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges God to call them; and if in rigour they be not worthy of this Favour, they merit it at leaſt in a ſeemlineſs of Equity and Congruity,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205125:11"/> as they ſpeak of it in the Schools of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore further, we may conceive it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of his Grace; no natural Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities can merit it, nor any Sin hinder the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of it. <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nos ſolemus eligere digniores, at Deus ut oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat ſuam electionem non ex noſtris meritis, ſed ex ſolâ ſua gratiâ fieri, ſolitus eſt indigniores eligere,</hi> Zanch. <hi>i. e.</hi> Men chuſe the moſt worthy, but the Lord chuſeth the moſt unworthy; to ſhew that his Choice is not grounded on our Merits, but on his own free Grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> It is for the Inſtruction of the Church. And ſo,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but that the Glory might be wholly aſcribed to the Lord, whoſe only work it muſt needs be acknowledged in ſuch <hi>Libertines.</hi> There is nothing to merit, nor any prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abilities ſtirring, to ſhare with the Lord in this Work. And indeed the Lord's power is moſt manifeſt in reclaiming ſuch wild Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, in waſhing ſuch Blackmoors, &amp; changing ſuch Leopards. <hi>Digitus Dei!</hi> All that ſee and hear, may wonder and ſay, It is the Finger of God; or (as <hi>Protogenes</hi> ſaid of a curious Line, which he ſaw drawn in a Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Shop, None but <hi>Apelles</hi> could draw this,) none but God could do this. It is a Work worthy of none, but of him who can do what he will, and will do what he hath purpoſed. This is indeed the great Miracle of the World,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205125:11"/> to change Lions into Lambs, Sinks into Fountains, Thorns into Roſes. Mercy is never ſo reſplendent as over Miſery. The Ice of Winter makes the Beauty of the Spring; Darkneſs contributes to the Luſtre of Light; nor is the Sun more bright, than after an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe: Thus Grace, which is the Splendor of Eternal Light, makes it ſelf to be ſeen in more triumph, where it hath ſubdued moſt Iniquity. And Praiſe will be more fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to him, by ſuch as could deſerve no favour, both occaſionally and practically. <hi>Occaſionally,</hi> in regard of others, who are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up thereby to admire his Power, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his Love, and to hope for acceptance upon their unfeigned ſubmiſſion: And <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> in reſpect of themſelves, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more humble and thankful, zealous and watchful ever after.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve ſuch as have drank deep of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Cup of Rebellion and Prodigality, and after come to taſte of the bitter Potion of ſound Humiliation, and ſay, whether you do not find them of an excellent temper? <hi>Paul</hi> being made ſenſible of himſelf, as the <hi>greateſt of Sinners,</hi> how paſſionatly doth he break forth to admire the Love and Mercy of God! <hi>I was a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, and injurious; but by the Grace of God I am what I am. And this Grace beſtowed upon me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly,</hi> &amp;c. Where you ſee his diligence in redeeming the Time, and aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205125:12"/> his Change wholly to the Grace of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That none in the Church ſhould deſpair, eſpecially among thoſe in whom the Offer of Mercy hath ſtirred up any deſire after Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Reaſon is rendred by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For this cauſe I obtained Mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all Long-ſuffering, for a Pattern to them which ſhould after believe on him to Life everlaſting.</hi> He that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be an <hi>Epitome,</hi> an Abridgment of all Wickedneſs, obtained Mercy for this cauſe, that Jeſus Chriſt might <hi>ſhew forth all Long-ſuffering, i. e.</hi> evidence by full demonſtration, ſo that all might ſee, and ſay, There is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with Chriſt that he may be feared, yea, Mercy rejoycing over Judgment.

If <hi>Manaſſes, Saul, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and ſome of the adulterous drunken <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were remembred in

Some of theſe means prepare the Subject, others work the Cure; the ſecond beginning where the firſt leaveth; all ſo knit and ordered, that they make up but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral mean to produce ſuch an end. It is the Lord's Patience and Wiſdom ſo to deal
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:205125:13"/> with froward Man, no want of power; he could do it by few and weak means; as great Ships are turned by a ſmall Helm, and as ſome ſay, ſtopped by a very little <hi>Remora,</hi> yea, without any; but it is Man's froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that requires this variety of means. To bring home, and keep the <hi>Jews,</hi> his firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved People, in Order and Safety, he planted a Vineyard, fenced it, and gathered out the Stones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2. <hi>He hewed them by his Prophets, ſending them early and late.</hi> Hoſea 6.4. <hi>He laid his Hand upon them, ſo that the Head was ſick, and the whole Heart faint,</hi> Iſa. 1.6. Concluding, when none of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do unto thee? O Judah, how ſhall I perſuade thee?</hi> Hoſ. 6.4. Which is as if God ſhould ſay, I have done mine utmoſt, and more than you can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge from me. And the like expoſtulary Expreſſions of complaint are to be found in many other places. And this the Lord doth:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.

God might have dealt with us as with the Angels, who were the eldeſt Off-ſpring of his Love, the pureſt production of that Supreme Light: no Mercy interpoſed to avert or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their Judgment, but they were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly expell'd the Divine Preſence, and left
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:205125:14"/> without remedy; <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.16. <hi>To which of them hath he appointed a Word of Reconciliation?</hi> And again, <hi>He took not upon him the Nature of Angels.</hi> But, O Goodneſs Divine! he made ſudden way for our recovery; high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were levell'd, and great Depths fill'd up, that we might arrive at Happineſs. He had Bowels only melting over loſt Man. As it is with a tender-hearted Father towards his weak and ſick Child; he deſires the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his Life, and if it were in his power, with ſome of his own Blood to give him health; he looks and ſighs, he weeps and complains, <hi>O my Son, what ſhall I do for thee?</hi> To the opinion of one, he adds the Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Phyſicians; he makes uſe of this Receipt, and applies that Remedy, and all to try what may do him good. Thus, but in a more tranſcendent manner (removing Paſſion and Imperfection, Ignorance and Weakneſs found in Man) conceive of God. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a pleaſant Child?</hi> Jer. 31.20. <hi>Since I ſpake againſt him, I do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly remember him, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him.</hi> And, <hi>Why will ye die, ye Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> And again, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have gathered thee?</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Means cannot turn or encline themſelves to our help, unleſs God turn, encline, and command them. If God do not act and uſe them, the Inſtruments can do nothing. It was not the Clay and the Spittle that cured the blind Man, but Chriſt's anointing his eyes with them. What Muſic can the Organ Pipes make without breath? <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos may water; but God giveth the increaſe.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe they are not natural Agents, working by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Virtue, but ordained thereunto, and qualified by an higher hand. He that choſe them, maketh them effectual. According as God is pleaſed to work, or not to work; ſo they prove Aſſiſtances, or not Aſſiſtances to us. All the means in the World, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered, are but as a Mill, which grinds not the Corn, unleſs the Wind come to it; or like a Dial, on which if the Sun ſhine, it may direct us, but if the Sun lies under a Cloud, it is of no preſent uſe to us: So if God hold off from the means, if he breath not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:205125:17"/> them, and caſt not a lively Influence into them, they can do nothing for us. Means are not abſolute Lords of their own Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but ſubordinate Agents, and depend upon God, as for being, ſo for operation or reſtraint. As a Maſter, that puts a rich Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of Jewels into his Servant's Chamber, but keepeth the Key himſelf; none of the Jewels can be given out, but by his will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: In like manner, God hath put an aptneſs in the means to do us good, yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf keeps the Key, to give out according to to his good pleaſure. <hi>

We muſt with the skilful Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, have our Eyes on the Stars, and our Hands on the Stern. Provided ſtill, that the right means be uſed, hearing of the Word preached, Receipt of the Sacraments, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Prayer, that the Lord would be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:205125:17"/> pleaſed graciouſly to add his Influence, that thereby Grace may be begun, and ſtrengthned in the ſeveral Acts thereof; becauſe the Lord will not work by any means but ſuch as are of his own appointment. <hi>Naaman</hi> muſt be cleanſed by waſhing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> a River in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> not in <hi>Abana</hi> or <hi>Parphar,</hi> Rivers in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus.</hi> Now the forementioned means are of the Lord's appointment, as may be read in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. And as you muſt uſe the right, ſo you muſt be careful to uſe them as Means, that is,</p>

Man muſt not be <hi>Funambulus Virtutum,</hi> to uſe <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Phraſe, go in a narrow Tract of Obedience, pick and chuſe what he will do, and what not; follow God only in ſuch Duties as will ſuit with himſelf, and no further. There muſt be an illimited Reſolution for all the ways of Salvation. To ſlight any, is to ſlight the Author.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It muſt be ſincerely and conſtantly uſed in obedience to God's command, leaving the Lord free for time and meaſure. Confine not the Holy one, no not in your thoughts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Limit him not to time or means, <hi>[Deus non alligat gratiam Sacramentis]</hi> further than he is pleaſed to confine and limit himſelf. It was a bold carriage of <hi>Popilius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſador, towards <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when he drew a Circle round about him, and bad him give anſwer ere he ſtirred out of it, for he would be put off no longer.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:205125:19"/> not off, becauſe thou prevaileſt not at once or twice; <hi>He that endureth to the end, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Importunity prevails at length, no Oratory like to it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It may be concluded hence, that we may not reſt on the means. A Man may put his Hand, but not his Heart on them. God commands the one, but forbids the other. <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove might make uſe of her Wings to fly, but truſted only to the Ark; a Man uſeth his Feet to go over a Bridg, but truſteth to the Bridg for ſafety. Chriſtians may and muſt walk and fly with the Wings of Obedience, but in the mean time they muſt truſt to the Ark, to the Bridg, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to carry and lead them over the devouring Sea of Deſtruction; otherwiſe they rob God of his Honour [like <hi>Michal,</hi> who put an Image in <hi>David</hi>'s room, they put the Means in the room of God] and themſelves of the Help and Comfort. To advance the Means above their place, is a moſt compendious way to render them uſeleſs, to make the River a barren Wilderneſs; as to lay too much weight upon the Pillars raiſed by any Man's hands, is the way to pull the whole Frame upon their Heads: That Stomach will r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205125:19"/> we may be aſſured in his time, becauſe as it follows in the fourth and laſt Obſervation hence: <hi>Viz.</hi>

                              <hi>Doct. 4.</hi> That the Lord is earneſt in his Offer of Grace to all under the Means; ſo that if any periſh, it is through their own default.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Behold, I will allure, and I will ſpeak.</hi> He meaneth what he ſaith indefinitely, and will do what he meaneth, unleſs Men turn the deaf ear, and through ſtubborn reſiſtance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themſelves.

                        <p>This Point will appear two ways.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the truth of the Means deſigned by the Lord for ſuch an end. The Means are for the End, and the End is as truly and more really intended than the Means, if I may ſo ſpeak. Now it is certain and preſuppoſed, that the Lord is earneſt in the Means, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more in the end. A Man may love the End for it ſelf, but the Means are ever choſen and loved for the End. I cannot ſee how it can ſtand with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to be earneſt in the Means, and not to intend the End; or to offer that to any, which he hath no purpoſe to give. <hi>The

                        <p n="2">2. It appears from the qualification of the Means.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is proportioned to the Nature of a reaſonable Creature. The Lord works not upon Men, as on Blocks or Brutes, or on the Stars, who being irrational, and uncapable of acting by any Rule, are therefore acted, and run their Courſe by the mighty Word of God's Power, they live of the Spirit's Omnipotency, and immediate Acts. But on Men he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as upon Creatures endued with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will; he <hi>enlightneth, allureth, ſpeaketh unto the Heart,</hi> and perſuadeth by ſuch Arguments and Motives, as cannot be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. A Sign that the Lord doth really intend what he doth pretend.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is followed cloſe with Precepts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining them Conſtancy in the uſe of ſuch means, preſſing <hi>Line upon Line,</hi> day after day, <hi>here a little, and there a little;</hi> and divers Promiſes of acceptance and ſucceſs. See thoſe pathetical and affectionate Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which hold forth not only his Will, but the ſtrength and height of it in this matter. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord;</hi> then the Ingemination of it, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye,</hi> with a vehement expoſtulation, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> And in divers other places. Which does aſſure us, that the Lord doth really purpoſe what he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205125:20"/> ſpeaks, and is more ready to give, than Man is to accept. <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as if God did beſeech you by us; we pray in Chriſt's ſtead to be reconciled to God.</hi> And who can think or ſay, he doth not deſiré our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation? It is highly injurious to conclude, <hi>Deum non ſincerè velle, quod ſe velle dicit, ſub conditione:</hi> That God doth not truly and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> will what he ſaith and willeth, under the conditions of Faith and Repentance. What Comfort or encouragement is there for a poor Sinner to come home to God, if this fail? In and from whom theſe three Grounds are required.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he be perſuaded of God's love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that he willeth indeed his Health and Safety in particular.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Terms on which he willeth it, are the Conditions of the new Covenant, Faith and Repentance.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That an unfeigned ſubmiſſion to God's own Ordinances, is the right and ready way to enable the Soul to perform theſe Conditions, and ſo to attain the End. Whoſo would be ſaved, muſt be well grounded and throughly perſuaded of this.</p>
                        <p>And ſo much for the firſt thing mentioned in the beginning. The ſecond and third fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which contain the main Buſineſs inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and are the Marrow of the Text. <hi>Viz.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205125:21"/> ſeduce another way for her good. Even as Lovers uſe to improve all their Art and Skill to perſuade and obtain the good Will of thoſe whom they love and affect to marry: So the Lord being in love with his People, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to marry them to himſelf, in and by his Son for ever, ſpeaks thus in the Lovers Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, <hi>I will allure her,</hi> and cauſe her to do what ſhe would not, that afterwards ſhe may do what ſhe ſhould.

Which doubtleſs may be admitted as a Conſequent of the former, both ſerving to ſet forth this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Work, as a neceſſary diſpoſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Converſion. For as Faith is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant, ſo is this Preparation the Condition of Faith.

                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing to be noted here, is the State and Condition of all ſuch as are under this preparative Work of the Law. They are ſaid to be <hi>in the Wilderneſs,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. A turning of thoſe to be converted out of all the deceitful Holds of Nature, wherein Men uſually ſhelter themſelves againſt the Power of the Word of God. The ready way (we know) to take the Hare, is by driving her from her Coverts and Burroughs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe doth uſe to hide her ſelf from the Dogs that purſue her: ſo here.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A preſentation to the eye of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, of many ſpiritual Dangers, as ſo many roaring Cannons on every ſide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Chriſtleſs Perſon is environed; ſo that he, who thought all to be well with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while he remained ſecurely aſleep in the ſtate of Nature, now ſeeth all to be quite naught, and out of order He dreamed he was rich, happy, and wanted nothing; but being awake, he ſeeth himſelf poor, miſerable,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205125:22"/> and naked. Alas for wo! Within him he hears Conſcience telling him the truth; <hi>above</hi> him he beholds God offended, frowning, and turning his loving Countenance from him; <hi>beneath</hi> him he ſeeth and feeleth Hell opening her Mouth to receive him, having deſerved, as he now judgeth, the loweſt Room, the darkeſt Corner, and the fierceſt Flames there; <hi>about</hi> him trouble and fear is on every ſide. He is weary of Life, becauſe of Sin; and yet afraid to die, becauſe of the account; alone he is tempted and terrified, and in company he is defiled or grieved. What to do, or whither to go, he knoweth not. This is a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> indeed. As it is with a wounded Hart, who feeling the Shaft, runs from the Woods to the Plain, and from thence to the Woods again, but finds no eaſe at all, <hi>Haeret lateri laethalis arundo,</hi> the deadly Shaft ſticks faſt in his ſide. Or as it was with the ancient <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> led by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> from <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, into the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Liberty of fruitful <hi>Canaan,</hi> but through a vaſt Wilderneſs, full of Troubles, Conflicts, Trials: So it is with the <hi>Woman,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and every Member thereof, out of Chriſt, but coming on towards him, they begin to ſee their Sins, they hear the terrible Threats of the Law, they fear the Wrath of God, as a juſt Judg; they run up and down, here for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and there for comfort, like Men afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſtraction, (for ſo the blind World
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205125:23"/> judgeth them) and cannot be comforted, till the Lord ſpeak unto their Hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It imports variety of Afflictions, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon the former Efficacy, and Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Law. And theſe are both poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and privative, ſometimes one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both, as need requires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Privatively,</hi> the Lord deals with Men, when he deprives them of Sacrifices, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of Wealth, Honour, Food, Houſe, Friends, or Liberty, and the like; to purſue and follow them with Infamy, Poverty, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, or Captivity; and all to humble, and make them pliant to his Hand for their good. [He made <hi>Jeſhurun</hi> look with lean Cheeks, that he might leave kicking, and learn Righteouſneſs.] <hi>I will take away the bravery of thy tinkling Ornaments, and inſtead of a ſweet ſmell, there ſhall be a ſtink; inſtead of a Girdle, a Rent; and Baldneſs inſtead of well-ſet Hair,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Crux ſalutare remediun eſt ad tollendam cordis duritiem, non naturâ ſuâ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> The Croſs is a wholſom Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to humble and ſoften the hard Heart, not in it ſelf, (as the Pool of <hi>Bethſaida</hi> did not at any time give healing, but when the Angel deſcended into it) but by a Spiritual Power, uſing that Inſtrument to bow us.</p>
                     <p>Now ſtand, and lay all theſe together, then you may ſay, <hi>This is the Wilderneſs,</hi> or, thus is a Soul prepared for Chriſt. The whole

                     <p>As <hi>God-Man,</hi> the <hi>Mediator,</hi> ſo he is the Meritorious Cauſe, procuring and preſerving Life for and in all his. How, and why this ſhould be appropriated to the Son, when as there is but one Nature, and ſo one Principle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205125:24"/> of Action, common to all the Perſons in that ſacred and ever bleſſed Trinity, is ſomewhat difficult to believe, but more hard to conceive and expreſs: poſſibly the following Reaſons may give ſome light unto it. Thus it is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch was the Will of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite Wiſdom ſo to order it, that the ſecond Perſon only ſhould undertake the Office of Mediation, fulfil the Law, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy Juſtice, and diſpenſe Grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is a mixt Work, neither ſimply <hi>Opus ad extra,</hi> wholly outward, for ſo it is common, the Father and the Holy Ghoſt do cooperate with the Son in this Diſpenſation; nor altogether <hi>Opus ad intra,</hi> an inward Work, for then there were no doubt nor ſcruple: but it might be perſonal, limited to any of the three, as it was in the Incarnation, all the three Perſons were Joint-workers in a preparative Inchoation, yet in the end and complement of it, we ſee it was terminated in and upon the Perſon of the Son. The Divine Nature was incarnate, as relatively contracted (with due reverence and ſubmiſſion be it ſpoken) to a certain manner of ſubſiſtence in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son. <hi>Quomodo tota Filii</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:205125:25"/> fruition of Grace, is in and by the Son; firſt elected to that Hypoſtatical Union between the two Natures, to the Office of Mediation, then given as Head unto the Church, whence Life and Motion is derived to his Myſtical Body, elect in and after him.</p>

                     <p n="4">4thly. Here is to be conſidered the <hi>End</hi> whereunto all this is directed; and that is twofold, either laſt, or next. The <hi>laſt</hi> End is the Glory of his rich Grace, in the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Spouſe, the Church; the <hi>next</hi> End is the preſent Good of the Perſons to be converted; being thus under preparation for Regeneration. As it is with a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, that would make a Cup for uſe, or a Ring for Ornament; his Oar is hard, and full of droſs, therefore he caſteth it into the Fire, to ſoften and refine it; this done, he formeth and faſhioneth it according to his Will. <hi>Gregory</hi> applieth this Similitude thus: We are the Gold, hard, and full of filth; this World is the Shop, Troubles are the Fire, God the Workman; let us learn how to ſuffer, he knoweth beſt how to prepare and fit us for his Service. As skilful Phyſicians hunt away

Or, as it is with a tender Mother, who clothes her Breaſt with Gall or Wormwood, to wean the Child in its Affections, and gain it to eat ſtronger Meat; ſo and no otherwiſe is it with the Lord in this Work; he weaneth them from the Dugs of the World, and leadeth them into the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> that he might bring them into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now no trouble for the <hi>preſent ſeemeth joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſs afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to them that are exerciſed therein,</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them to ſay, it was good for us that we were afflicted and broken, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in more ſtrength.

                     <p>For the further opening of the Point, and conſequently of this <hi>preparative</hi> Work to the capacity of the meaner ſort, three things ſhall be here inſiſted on, <hi>viz.</hi> That it <hi>hath</hi> been ſo, <hi>bow</hi> it is effected, and <hi>wherefore.</hi> In which we ſhall find what <hi>Sampſon</hi> did in the Lions Belly, many Honey combs of Spiritual Honey.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This hath been, and is the Method ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ordinarily in the Diſpenſation of Grace, though a diverſity may be granted as to the meaſure of it. Look as in Muſic, all the Strings of the Inſtrument are touched with the ſame hand, yet not with a like ſtroke; ſo here. And the Lord is the Agent: for Man being once turned from Life, and dead in Sin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring himſelf into any of this wholſom Pain, much leſs out of it; no, no, it is the Lord that in great Love doth both theſe for him. Our firſt Parents had a legal Sermon made to them, before they had any Promiſe applied, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hagar</hi> was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> [real to her, typical to others,] before ſhe was fully wrought upon in Faith to ſay, <hi>I have ſeen him that ſeeth me,</hi> Gen. 16.13. God begins the Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeeth his, before they ſee or ſeek him. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was ſent into Captivity, he was put in Priſon, and fettered in Irons (the beſt Ornaments he ever wore) before his Mountain could be brought low. In ſuch a proud Heart the Devil keeps his hold a long time; ſuch ruſty Locks will not eaſily
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:205125:28"/> open. Now he is as weary of his Sins, as he is of his Chains. As a <hi>Phyſician</hi> deals with Perſons diſtracted, and out of their wits; he commands that they be kept in the dark, to be bound in fetters, to have miſerable and hard Fare, that by all they may be brought to their Underſtanding: Thus God dealeth with ſome Sinners, that are turned mad, and grown out of their right Reaſon by their Wickedneſs, that he may recover them, he binds them in Chains, brings them low, that at length they may conſider of their Condition, and be healed. <hi>Paul</hi> had both a Voice and Light to guide him into this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> before the Lord would <hi>ſpeak unto his Heart,</hi> and tell him what he ſhould do. And thoſe of whom mention is made, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.16.30. with many other ſuch of our own obſervation, were brought into great diſtreſs, through fear and deſire; fear of Sin, deſire of God's Love and Favour, not able to reſiſt any where; <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Comforts they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, Threatnings they apply with hand and heart, witty and ready they are to hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as if their vital and animal Spirits were ſtopp'd in their Paſſage by ſome Diſeaſe, they are often near ſinking; ſuch affinity and agreement there is between the Mind and the Body. Obſerve ſuch troubled Spirits, you may, to look heavily, ſigh deeply, as if the Heart would break, and at laſt to cry out, Wo and alas! if this and that be ſo, as I fear it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:205125:28"/> is, and do believe, how can I be ſaved? If the ſpots of a Leopard can be wiped out, if the hue of an <hi>Indian</hi> can be changed, if a <hi>Camel</hi> can go through the eye of a Needle; then may I be cleanſed, renewed, and ſaved. But Lord, how can that be? is there any Balm, any Blood, any Mercy, for ſuch an one as I? Tell me, O my Friends, ſpeak thou Man of God, was there ever ſuch an one read or heard of? a preſumptuous Sinner, a beaſtly Wretch, a cloſe Lover of Wickedneſs, an Hater of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? To look upon, I am afraid of my ſelf; what ſhall I do? whither ſhall I fly? ſay, do not you loath me, and bluſh to behold and hear me? was there ever ſuch an one as I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?</p>
                     <p>This is that narrow Way, that leads many to Life; that great Strait, whereinto the right dearly beloved of the Lord are often brought, to learn, how that is poſſible to God, which is impoſſible with Men. As the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by God's appointment is to bring forth in pangs and travail; ſo muſt the Heart of Man ordinarily labour, till <hi>Chriſt be formed</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How and after what manner doth the Lord effect this?</p>
                     <p>It is either by removing Impediments, or by preſenting to the Eye of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) The many deceitful Grounds there are, whereon Men naturally reſt, and boaſt of,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:205125:29"/> as if their Eſtate at worſt were well enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And till theſe deceitful Props be removed, they will not in earneſt ſeek after Chriſt, much leſs accept him, to reſt upon him. Theſe the Lord removes, by ſhewing unto Men their weakneſs and inſufficiency to yeeld them any comfort. And they are either inward, or outward: <hi>Inward,</hi> as Knowledg without Love, Invention without Judgment, and a Memory without any practical delight in the Notions retained, [all which a Man may have, and yet be no better than a Devil,] the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Baptiſmal Regeneration, without any care or thought to perform Conditions. Theſe being without the power of Godlineſs, are only as a dead Corps ſtrewed and adorned with Flowers, as a gouty Foot covered with a Crimſon Shoo, or a Statue of Earth and Dirt, with ſome glorious colouring, and old Sepulchers, with new painting over them. The Lord convinceth them, that this <hi>Ark</hi> is not ſure enough to keep them in the deluge of many Waters, yea, that all things without Grace will prove an Aggravation of their Condemnation. As in ſome Countries, when their Malefactor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:205125:29"/> and Formality, all commendable in their kind, but not ſufficient. Theſe Men may have, and yet come ſhort of Grace and Life in Glory. Few rich Men ſhall be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. Corpulent Birds ſeldom fly high. Theſe <hi>many things</hi> cumber them: And, <hi>If your Righteouſneſs exceed not the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> The beſt of theſe are but Weeds in God's Garden, Tares in his Wheat, Chaff in his Floor. Therefore the Lord doth wiſely and timely remove theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments.</p>

He preſenteth Sin, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents thereof, in their true Colours, pulleth off the Skin of that Viper, waſhes off the paint, and ſhews its Face in full deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

As in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, and the Prodigal Son, we have an Inſtance. The former (<hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21.) declare the force of Conſcience, and fruit of Affliction. Old Sins are brought to a new reckoning. <hi>We are very guilty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Brother, in that we ſaw the Anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear, therefore is this Evil come upon us.</hi> The latter came to himſelf, when he was under want; his Affliction, like <hi>Eye-bright</hi> Water,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:205125:30"/> had a ſtrange and great Influence on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulled Sight; now he reſolves to <hi>go to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Yea, many now living can ſay, I doubt not, <hi>It is good</hi> for them that they have been <hi>afflicted.</hi> They had been undone, had they not been undone; that they might go weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Heaven, while others go laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Hell. <hi>Poverty</hi> may be ſo ordered, as to prove a Preparative to Spiritual Riches: <hi>Impriſonment</hi> antecedent to Evangelical Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Sickneſs and weakneſs of Body often tendeth to the ſtrength and health of the Inner Man. This brings to mind that Story in <hi>Bromiardus</hi> concerning an Apprentice that had ſerved an hard Maſter, by whom he had been ſore beaten. Theſe Blows the Lord had made a means of the Man's Converſion. Whereupon lying on his Death-bed, and his Maſter ſtanding by, he catched hold faſt on his hands, and kiſſed them, ſaying, <hi>Hae manus perduxerunt me ad Paradiſum,</hi> Theſe hands have helped to bring me to Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Beza</hi> tells us of himſelf, that God was pleaſed to lay the Foundation of his Spiritual Health, in a violent Sickneſs which befell him at <hi>Paris.

                     <p n="3">[3.] Uſually it is by the Miniſtry of the Law, [that School-maſter, whoſe Laſh makes Sinners Backs to ſmart,] whereby the Lord awakeneth Conſcience indeed, and ſtriketh terror into the Hearts of his Choſen, caſting them down very low to Self-denial; he breaks their ſtony Hearts in pieces, convincing Men as Tranſgreſſors, telling them that they are the Men, even Men of Death; this they have done, and that they deſerve, diſcovering millions of Sins more than they ever dreamed of, quickning Sin in the Conſcience, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Weapon into its hand to kill the Sinner under his Guilt. For this is properly the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Law to detect and convince Men of ſuch and ſuch Sins, to paſs ſentence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:205125:31"/> againſt them for thoſe Sins, and to follow them ſo convicted, with a thundring noiſe from place to place, hedging and hemming them in on every ſide, that they can neither get out, nor be quiet any where, till they humble themſelves and fall down before the Lord's Mercy-Seat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may not exclude from this Preparative Work, a branch of the Goſpel, which the Lord makes uſe of, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting this Preparation; by it, as by beams and heat from a Fire far off, to ſoften and melt thoſe broken pieces, that ſo the Heart being ready to fall aſunder, and grieving more kindly than it can do under mere Legal Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, may readily and delightfully admit of Spiritual Infuſions, and be the more ſpeedily brought into a new Mould. And this the Goſpel doth,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By unvailing unto ſuch diſtreſſed Minds, the holy and pure Nature of God himſelf [which the Law diſcovereth only as he is a Creature, the Goſpel further, as he is a Father] his patience and loving kindneſs in Chriſt, his rich Mercy, great Love, Free-Grace, thoſe Spiritual Beams by which the Divine Nature ſhines forth upon us. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> One, that is ſo holy and harmleſs; one that hath done ſo much for thee; one that doth ſo entirely love thee, and deſire thy good; Haſt thou none to ſin againſt but thy <hi>Saviour?</hi> None to abuſe

This ſtruck the Nail on the Head, this made his Eyes to water, his Heart to melt; with this kind ſalutation, <hi>Saul's</hi> hard Heart was ſoftned and made pliable to a further work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By diſcovering the ſinfulneſs of Sin; that it is not only <hi>fearful,</hi> as the Law ſaith, but <hi>filthy</hi> alſo; not only <hi>evil,</hi> but the <hi>greateſt</hi> evil; whence once diſrobed of that pleaſing and deceitful ſhining Skin, patcht up of the ſhreds of Pleaſure, Profit, and Carnal Content, it is apprehended as oppoſit to the greateſt Good, and conſequently more to be hated and avoided than Hell: There is no Hell without Sin, nor any Heaven with Sin: Hell is <hi>Penal,</hi> but Sin is a <hi>Criminal</hi> evil: The evil of <hi>pain</hi> is contrary to the good of a <hi>finite</hi> being only, while the evil of <hi>fault</hi> is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to an <hi>infinite</hi> purity. Both theſe, namely, the Law and the Goſpel, being thus ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, preſt and applied to the ſinners Soul, ſo that he can find no ſtarting hole to evade, no corner to run into, no gap open to get out of this <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> by this time, it comes to paſs, that he finds a combuſtion in his Breſt, a fire kindled in his Bones, ſuch new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as he never felt: now Hope appears, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Deſpair; at one time Fear, another time Love cometh into the Soul, like flaſhes of Lightning, both followed with Tears
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:205125:32"/> and Complaints; he may be often heard to ſigh, and ſometime to beat the Breſt, and ſay, O Lord, that I could repent! O that I could believe! O that I had a ſoft tender Heart! <hi>That my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a fountain of Tears, that I might weep Day and Night:</hi> Help me, O my Friends, for the <hi>terrours of the Almighty oppreſs me, he makes me inherit the ſins of my youth,</hi> ſo that I am ready to ſink. Help me, O my God, to do what thou commandeſt, command what thou wilt, and thou ſhalt not command in vain. Make me a Man after thy own Heart; give me, O give, if not a Fountain, yet a Stream; if not a Stream, yet ſome few drops of penitent Tears, to eaſe a burdned Heart, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a loathſom Soul for the more precious ſtreams of Chriſt's Blood.</p>
                     <p>And yet, as if all this were not enough, behold and ſee, there ſteppeth up another Witneſs more, againſt this terrified Creature: And that is, a reflecting power of the Soul, called <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which joyneth with the Law and Goſpel in their Sentence, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alone, as flying from both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and hoping ſomewhere to eſcape, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults the poor Soul, and concludes to this effect: Nay, whither now? Think not to ſhift off all, hope not to carry all away, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did the Gates; go not about to hide it, do not deny or extenuate it; for all this is true which thou haſt heard, from the Law
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:205125:32"/> and Goſpel. O wretched Creature! thus and thus hath God walked towards thee, in Juſtice, in Mercy, in Power, in Patience and Bounty, he ſent Chriſt with healing in his Wings, to heal and do thee good; and yet thus and thus rebelliouſly and ungratefully haſt thou walked towards him; thou haſt put away Salvation, bolted out thy Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: What wilt thou ſay? Whither wilt thou go? Nay, nay, think not of pleading, dream not of flying, much leſs of any hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, except thou wilt contract farther guilt, and a greater burden on thy ſelf, which is heavy enough already: Down proud Heart, down with it lower than thy Knees, cloath thy ſelf in Sack-cloth and Aſhes, put a Rope about thy Neck, as <hi>Benhadads</hi> Servants did, confeſs thy faults humbly, aggravate thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingenuouſly, and then thou mayſt hope to hear the voice of Mercy; there is no way to flie from him, but by falling down before him; Blood-letting is a cure of Bleeding. To cloſe and get in, is the only way to avoid the blow.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Why the Lord thus brings his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the Wilderneſs?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> All God's Actions are ordered by infinite Wiſdom, therefore ſome reaſon may always be rendred of his Will: In caſe we apprehend it not, we muſt acknowledg the weakneſs of our own Capacities and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, without enquiring after any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:205125:33"/> becauſe we know it is his Will: Yet in this buſineſs, ſomething may be ſaid as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and with due reverence.</p>
                     <p>He doth it, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To divorce the Heart from Sin, and to break that Love-knot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Heart and Sin in every Natural Man; which ordinarily is not done without ſome throws of this Spiritual Trouble. While Men run up and down in the ſeeming pleaſant fields of Liberty, ſin is ſweet and fair unto them, ſo far from fear that they are in love with it. Who ever ſaw a covetous <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer</hi> troubled in mind when he is telling his Money, and reckoning up his Bonds and Bills? An <hi>Adulterer</hi> mourning with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs in his Arms? <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> indeed was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and troubled among his Cups, and ſo are ſome Drunkards; but that was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary judgment. While Men are Drunk with Pleaſures, and beſotted with delightful Objects, commonly they are not ſenſible of any danger, but being once brought into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of fear and ſolitary Silence, they have leaſure to conſider, and ability to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that Sin is treacherous as a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as Gall, Ugly, more ugly than the Devil: And then they loath and fly it, then they cry out, <hi>Lord, what wouldſt thou have us to do?</hi> When before, they would not be ruled, nor perſuaded by any reaſon. The <hi>Jews</hi> will not part with their Idols, till they bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Captivity; nor <hi>Sampſon</hi> with <hi>Dalilah,</hi> till
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:205125:33"/> ſhe betray him into the hands of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines;</hi> then away Idols, and let <hi>Dalilah</hi> be burned alone; <hi>Sampſon</hi> repenteth. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per beaten, caſteth up her Poyſon. The Traytor on the Rack, will confeſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all. <hi>The burnt Child dreads the fire;</hi> and the Wormwood upon the Breſt, weans the Child from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is to humble the Soul, and cauſe her to ſet a right Eſtimate upon Chriſt, hitherto undervalued. Chriſt would not be ſo ſweet, if Sin were not ſo bitter. The Man upon whom the Law hath not paſſed Sentence, will not ſay <hi>Gramercy</hi> for a Pardon. Beſides, it is neceſſity that endears any thing to us. Extremity of pain, makes us to prize a little eaſe; and extremity of want, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a little plenty. <hi>Darius</hi> being vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and in flight being in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Thirſt, drank Water out of a Puddle, mingled with much Blood of ſlain Souldiers, and ſaid, It was the ſweeteſt Drink that ever he taſted in his Life. The <hi>Prodigal</hi> that diſregarded all the Dainties of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe,</hi> did highly value the Servants Bread there, when he was reduced to feed upon <hi>Husks</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> As it is with a weary Swimmer floating in the reſtleſs Sea, ready to ſink every moment, how welcome is a bough to him, when as if he had been upon the ſhoar, he would not have regarded it. So it is with ſuch a wearied Man brought
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:205125:34"/> into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of great diſtreſs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he is ſo humble and gentle, that a <hi>Child may lead him:</hi> He cried out, and looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, but few hear, none can help him. O how welcome then is the Thought, the Sight, the Preſence of Chriſt, that <hi>Tree of Life!</hi> He will part with all, Sins, Goods, Liberty, Life, or any thing, if he may but <hi>touch the hem of his Garment.</hi> Only then, and to all ſuch he is a <hi>Jeſus</hi> indeed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is, that they may be the better ever after. More zealous and ſerviceable to God, who hath ſome great Work (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) for ſuch to do, and therefore their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is anſwerable. A high Building muſt have a low Foundation. <hi>Luther</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of himſelf, that when God was about to ſet him upon any ſpecial Service, he either laid ſome fit of Sickneſs upon him before-hand, or turned Satan looſe upon him. For he was much exerciſed and beaten from his tender years with Spiritual Conflicts; as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> teſtifieth in his Life. And this was in all likelihood to fit him for the great Work, the Lord had cut out unto him. There is no whole Heart to the broken: None ſo ſound to hold Grace, as that; and the more it is broken, the more it contains. A Paradox in Nature, but not in Grace. <hi>Beſides,</hi> they are hereby made more compaſſionate, and helpful unto others. Hence it was that God gave <hi>Luther</hi> ſuch a Grace, that in his Sermons,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:205125:34"/> all that heard him, thought every one, his own Temptations had been toucht and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him; and when ſignification thereof was made to him by his Friends, and being demanded how it could be? anſwered, Mine own Temptation and Experience are the cauſe thereof. As a Phyſician that trieth the virtue of ſome ſovereign compoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Body, he is the better able to Cure another with that Receipt. It is a great invitation to Mercy, to ſee one in the ſame condition that we our ſelves have been in: As he ſaid, <hi>Haud ignara mali, miſeris ſuccurrere diſco.</hi> As a Woman that hath had a Child can more pity ſuch as are in Travel, becauſe ſhe hath ſuffered the like pain. When Chriſtians by their own experience know the Way, like old Travellers, they can lead o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and bring them into, and guide them through this Spiritual Trouble, ſaying; Thus and thus were I brought in, and ſo came I off; this courſe I took, and this ſucceſs I found, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Experienced Learners, are the beſt Teachers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſome of many Reaſons which might be given, of the Lord's proceeding in this manner towards his People. The Sum of all is, <hi>for their good.</hi> He caſteth them down very low, that he might lift them up the higher, he leads them through a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> to convey them into <hi>Canaan:</hi> As hereafter will appear. So much by way
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:205125:35"/> of Doctrine. The <hi>Application</hi> follows, which is a principal part of this Diſcourſe. And</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It condemneth ſuch firſt, as are frequently in the <hi>Wilderneſs of Sin,</hi> and wanton Prodigality, but never in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> of ſorrow and ſaving Fear; much under Worldly, but never under Spiritual Trouble. How far are ſuch from Grace, who have not paſt this Preparation? How far from Chriſt, from Comfort, from true Happineſs? As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, Darkneſs from Light, <hi>Belial</hi> from Chriſt, in point of Communion. Such have cauſe to fear, that Sin ſits like a Queen in her Regency, that the <hi>ſtrong Man</hi> keeps Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and that they are ſlaves to Satan, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Kingdom of Darkneſs. A Man may have ſome Trouble and yet not be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but he cannot be Converted without ſome Trouble. The Heart cannot be broken for Sin, without the ſight of Sin. The Sun looketh upon the Earth, thence draweth up Vapours, and diſtilleth them down again; ſo doth the Sun of the Underſtanding, which till it be Convicted, the Heart cannot be Compuncted. Sight of Sin muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precede ſorrow for Sin. An Infant in the Womb cries not, becauſe it ſeeth not; but as ſoon as it comes into the Light, ſets up its note. The blind Eye and the hard Heart go together, as unſeparable Companions. Men will never loath themſelves, till there be a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:205125:35"/> remembring of their ways and doings that have not been good, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>It may be demanded, who are they, and how they are kept out?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who they are that were never yet in this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> may eaſily be known by what hath been ſpoken already, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this preparative Work; let any one bring himſelf, and compare his preſent eſtate with it, and the truth will readily be diſcovered; eſpecially if he conſider, and impartially anſwer to ſuch like demands.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whether he doth not retain in his Heart the love of ſome Sin, which either he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or might know to be a Sin: Though he do many things, yet hath he not an <hi>Herodias</hi> that he will not part with. Though, with the <hi>Vintner,</hi> he pull down the Buſh, yet hath he not as much Heart to his Sin as ever? Though he pull down the Shop-window [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form outward Sins] yet doth he not follow his Trade within door? Doth he not ſit brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Sin? It is hypocritical repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when Men leave ſome Sins only, and not others alſo: They can part with ſome kind of Corruptions, [it may be they are angry with them] but then there are others of which it may be ſaid, as was of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s <hi>Sword,</hi> none like to that. For as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance takes revenge upon every Sin, ſo more eſpecially upon that the Sinner took moſt delight in: As <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who ſubſcribed with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:205125:36"/> his right Hand, what was againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, afterward with revenge put that firſt into the Flame; ſo doth the truly humbled Soul, take <hi>revenge</hi> on that Sin by which he hath moſt diſhonoured God. In a word, ſuch actions of the Soul which admit of private reſervations and indulgences, and are not general, as to this matter, will be found a <hi>Meteor</hi> of the Brain, not an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whether the injoyments of the World are not more precious in his eſteem, than the Love and Favour of God? For this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Man that hath been under this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Work, cannot but prefer the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God's Love to all the World. Therefore <hi>David</hi> prayed that God would remember him with the Favour which he beareth to his People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.4, 5. this he accounted his chiefeſt good. And <hi>Luther</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, he would not be put off with the things of this Life, Left-hand Bleſſings. To whom may be added that Noble <hi>Italian</hi> Marqueſs, who accounted not that Man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of a Chriſtian, who preferred not one Day's communion with God, to all the ſplendour of the whole Earth. Now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this demand; How ſtand your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Chriſt, and other things below him? Are they to Chriſt as a Spark, to other things as a Flame? The Unregenerate Man's joy is diffuſed to Earthly things, but limited to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:205125:36"/> Spiritual things. Say, are you not more chearful in Sinning, than in the performance of holy Duties? As it is with thoſe Fiſhes that breed your Orient Pearls; thoſe Pearls are the torment of the Fiſh, but when they are put upon a Man, they are an Ornament to him; ſo thoſe Sins which are the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, the Burden, the Sorrow of a good Man, are they not a matter of delight to you?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whether he doth not reſt upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what [Creature, or Action] more than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, or doth not prize ſomething above him, or equal with him? As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Marcellina</hi> hung Chriſt's Picture, and the Picture of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> together; Doſt not thou, O Man, ſet Chriſt and the World, or Chriſt and thy Duties together? A Man may magnifie Chriſt as willing to have him in the end, but part with nothing for him in the mean while; he may prize his Blood, but not his Grace; his Promiſes, but not his Precepts, Jeſus, but not Chriſt. If thine own Conſcience anſwer Affirmatively, it is an evident ſign thou haſt never been in this <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how are they kept out, ſeeing there is ſo much means to drive them into it? many Sons of Thunder, who heartily long after their Peoples ſafety, how are they hindred?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I conceive it is from theſe and the like Reaſons:</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:205125:37"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the Multitude, who run ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in the broad-way of Carnal Pleaſures, and draw multitudes after them. How ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is it for Men to <hi>follow</hi> a <hi>multitude to do evil?</hi> Few conſider that the way to Heaven is a <hi>narrow</hi> Way, and that they ſhould be wiſe with a few. Few are of the mind of <hi>Liberius,</hi> an Othodox Biſhop of the Second Primitive Times, who when he was preſt by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> to forſake the Truth, and vote for <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Art thou wiſer <hi>than all the World?</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſtly replied, The Truth is no whit prejudiced by my aloneneſs in ſtanding out; for of old there were but three that withſtood the wicked Edict of the King of <hi>Babel.</hi> Moſt are of this Principle, <hi>It is ſafe to do as the moſt do.</hi> Like dead Fiſh, they ſwim down the Stream, whitherſoever it runs; or like Water that takes the figure of the Veſſel into which it is caſt. They ſet their Dyal by the Town-Clock, not by the Sun. The Voice of the People is with them the Voice of God: They infer that way to be trueſt, which is the largeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By delay, and putting off ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts about Death and their Account, being afraid to hear of, much more to dive into their Eſtate, leſt they ſhould find that which would trouble them. <hi>The Cup is in the Sack.</hi> Thus the ſtory goes of <hi>Galba,</hi> who having received a very great ſum of Money
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:205125:37"/> from the ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not being able to give account for it, took more care to avoid giving account than to do it. Thus Men keep their Conſciences from conſidering their Conditions, becauſe it is ſo bad with them. Like bad Debtors, who are loth to come to account, leſt they ſhould find their Eſtates low. Or as Hereticks, that are <hi>Lucifugae Scripturarum,</hi> ſuch Owls that cannot abide the Day; they are afraid of diſcovering their Conditions, and ſo content themſelves in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, deceiving their own Souls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By fair promiſes of future amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the thing they will do but in their own time, as if the Clock of Mercy would ſtrike at their beck. Like thoſe ſpoken of, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The time is not yet come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) The time of rebuilding the Second Temple; it might be done hereafter: Such is the guife of graceleſs Men, to future and fool away their Salvation; hereafter may be time enough, and what need of ſuch haſte to build the Spiritual Temple: In ſpace comes Grace, ſay they; God is more merciful than ſo, At what time ſoever a ſinner repents, God will put away all his Wickedneſs; and thus they ſtand trifling with God and their own Souls, being always about to do that, which if not done, they are undone for ever. <hi>Fools and blind Men!</hi> As our Saviour calls the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> Mat. 23.17. Hence it is, when they are preſt to a ſpeedy meeting of God by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:205125:38"/> they anſwer as <hi>Antipater,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> did, when one preſented him a Book treating of Happineſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>I am not at leaſure:</hi> Or as <hi>Archias</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> when warn'd of a Conſpiracy againſt him, caſt the Letters by, ſaying, <hi>In craſtinum ſeria,</hi> and was ſlain ere the Morrow came: So theſe Men will amend hereafter, when they have neither Time nor Grace to command: They promiſe a time of Healing, but a time of Terrour and Torment may come. Jer. 14.19. <hi>Et jam ex Jeſu factus eſt damnator, ſalutem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequi non poſſum;</hi> as Father <hi>John</hi> ſaid, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to believe in Chriſt Jeſus, and to lay hold on his Merits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Cham. Epiſt. Jeſuit. pag.</hi> 124.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Others are kept off from a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the troubleſomneſs of the Way, and lothneſs to leave their Sins. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, while he was leaven'd with Popiſh Principles of Contritions and their Penance, there was not a more bitter word in all the Scripture than <hi>Repent;</hi> but when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Goſpel, nothing was more precious and welcom. Thus while the Duties of Religion are looked upon as clothed with Irkſomneſs, and burdenſome Men are ready to reject them; ſaying, O the Way of the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is tedious! They will not crucifie the Fleſh, cut off the <hi>Right-hand,</hi> and pull out the <hi>Right-eye;</hi> Men will do any thing to avoid it. The <hi>Jews</hi> would bring multitudes of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:205125:38"/> Sacrifices, kill many Bullocks and Rams, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any one Luſt; they would Sacrifice their Firſt-born, when they would not leave their ſins. It is an Hell to Unregenerate Men. <hi>Haſen Mullerus</hi> reports of one <hi>Franciſcus Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus,</hi> who wrote againſt the <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but upon ſome Conviction, wiſhed he had never read it, nor the Anſwer of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Sadeel,</hi> againſt him; for it had made him ſomewhat doubtful what to hold, or which way to go, and concludeth thus: God's Word promiſeth me comfort, if I forſake <hi>Rome. Sed ego ſenex hinc exire non poſſum:</hi> But I am old, and cannot depart hence. He could not ſubmit to the Trouble, as for the Comforts of Heaven, to depart from <hi>Rome.</hi> So, many Men are wedded to their Sins, they can upon no terms part with them. They love not Trouble. <hi>Chriſtianus eſt perpetua Naturae violentia:</hi> Chriſtianity is a perpetual violence againſt Nature; and therefore few are brought to it. Theſe and many other ſhifts, Natural Men have to hide themſelves from the Light and Stroke of the Word, ſo that they are not broken, benefited and brought by it into this <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Doctrine condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thoſe, that think themſelves to be in this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> before they are <hi>indeed,</hi> and ſo ſitting down under that miſconceit, never come there: Miſtaking every Sermon-ſick-paſſion,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:205125:39"/> every ſleight ſight of Sin, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Trouble, every Tear, for ſound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and unfeigned Humiliation. Let ſuch conſider [there may be much gliſtering where is no true Gold].</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> How far many have gone, and yet come ſhort. Some, like a Ship, have ſunk in the mouth of the Harbour. <hi>Eſau</hi> ſought the Bleſſing carefully, and with Tears. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf, even to the renting of his Clothes, and putting on of Sack-cloth. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> confeſſed his ſin, and made reſtitution, and both, doubtleſs, with abundance of trouble, and yet all came ſhort. It's plain, there were great troubles and fears about Sin, as if ſome excellent and beautiful Child of Grace had been to be born; but after all the troubles, pangs and fears, there came forth <hi>a great nothing;</hi> they are as loathſome and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as before. You have heard of, and known many to cry out in the agony of their Souls, We have ſinned grievouſly, what <hi>ſhall we do that we may be ſaved?</hi> And yet for all this Cry, this Travel, the Soul brings forth nothing but wind and emptineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Others that have entred upon it, but have too quickly withdrawn themſelves again; as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> did: The former cried out, <hi>My ſins are greater than I can bear;</hi> and therefore to eaſe himſelf, builds Cities, and uſeth all means to divert his fear and trouble: The latter, with <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:205125:39"/> puts it off to a more <hi>convenient time,</hi> he will conſider it another Seaſon. So, many among us, when the Miniſter is plain and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with them, the Word flaſheth in their Faces like Lightning, then they ſee their Sins diſtinctly, and are indeed afraid of Hell; the Voice ſounds ſtill in their Ears, and their Sins like ſo many Furies follow them, till they betake themſelves to ſome diverting imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or merry Company, to drive away ſuch melancholy dumps, as many uſe to ſpeak; like the wounded <hi>Hart,</hi> that labours to eat out the Arrow, they labour to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Sin, that it may not alway be before them, and then all is loſt, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been there at all: They quench the Fire that was kindled, and bolt out the Light that ſhined on them. Such Tears as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſe, are but like the Waters of ſtanding Pools, that breed Toads and other Vermin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A third ſort may be deep and long in this legal Terrour; ſo that they harden under it, and after a ſort grow proud of it; they can bewail their Sins, and cry out for inward fear and trouble (as if they were truly penitent) and yet live in them all the while; doing that with ſecret delight, which they pretend to fear and hate. O horrible deceit! ſo bleering the Eyes of Men, while they <hi>bathe</hi> Sin, but are unwilling to <hi>drown</hi> it: Reſting upon this, That once they were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:205125:40"/> humbled, and therefore they need not now fear or care.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another ſort are ſuch, who counterfeit Trouble, and complain of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of Mind, when in truth there is no ſuch matter. Like your common Beggars, who uſe to complain of ſuch Griefs and Troubles which they never felt; ſo theſe, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and weep, only becauſe they ſee and hear, that ſuch Sorrow is uſual among the Saints, and that ſuch are moſt approved who paſs this way, by the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of Legal Fear, into the <hi>Canaan</hi> of Evangelical Comforts; and therefore they would be thought to have, what they ſhould have in truth. The Devil is God's Ape, and imitates him in all his Methods and ordinary ways of Grace; that if poſſible by his Deluſions, he may gain ſome into his own Condemnation.</p>
                     <p>But to clear this a little further, there may be propoſed two Queſtions of moment, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>How far a wicked Man may go under this Preparative Work, and yet come ſhort of Grace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Wherein, and how far, thoſe which are called according to purpoſe, go beyond all others in this Trouble?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt, may be replied; That they are often brought into this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> at leaſt for ſome Degrees, is certain; how far
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205125:40"/> only is queſtioned. Therefore to anſwer directly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> They may be brought to <hi>Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Mind: By the Glaſs of the Law they may ſee what the Law requires, and how far ſhort they come in their Obedience, not without ſome trouble, and it may be great diſquiet: And this not only confuſedly, in Generals, as <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> but diſtinctly for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did. Of one it is ſaid, he repented and confeſſed, <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in betraying Innocent Blood,</hi> Mat. 27.3. And for the other, <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Humiliation is ſo great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27. that the Lord takes notice of it. See <hi>how Ahab humbleth himſelf!</hi> And ſo the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> How often were they in their Humiliations for ſin? But thoſe Land-floods were dried up again; in ſo much as <hi>Gregory</hi> compares them to the Graſs-hoppers, which make ſudden Leaps from the Earth, as if they would flie to Heaven, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall down to the Earth again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> They may be and are often brought to <hi>Conviction</hi> of the Will; that they may have nothing to ſay for themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Light of Divine Truth, in flaſhes cloſing with the Light of Conſcience. When that unprepared Gueſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. was queſtioned why he preſumed to come without his Wedding Garment; it is ſaid, <hi>he was ſpeechleſs;</hi> having no excuſe to pretend; he was Self-condemned.</p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:205125:41"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They may be brought to a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Application, ſo as to conclude a poſſibility of ſafety, that they might be freed from Sin, and Sentence of the Law, if they ſhould believe and lay hold on Chriſt. So far is conceived that <hi>Herod</hi> went, by hearing of the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> Yea, more, they may alſo have a fiducial Application and Appropriation of God unto themſelves in particular; and herein may have a great reſemblance of Juſtifying Faith. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> So theſe may apply Chriſt to their particular; I thank my Chriſt, my Redeemer, my Saviour, though in preſumption notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They may go one ſtep further; even to ſome apprehenſion of the Beauty of Grace, and that happineſs following a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Union with Chriſt: Eſpecially, if they live where the Law and Goſpel are diſtinctly handled, skilfully intermixed, fully applied; ſo as not only to wiſh well, but to reſolve and promiſe a better courſe: As appears from that known and famous Inſtance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. where the third kind of hearers are ſaid, to <hi>receive the Word with joy:</hi> As good News affecteth the hearers about the State and Kingdom, wherein they are much concern'd; ſo may Men be affected in hearing the glad tidings, the gracious Counſels of God to ſave Sinners diſcovered, and yet not regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To which may be added, that difficult
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:205125:41"/> place in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. Many Apoſtates have had great meltings, and much ſudden and ſtrong joy. But the Iſſue of all is, they ever daſh on one of theſe two Rocks: Either they <hi>Preſume,</hi> and ſo are careleſs to go on actually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and give themſelves to Chriſt: Or elſe they <hi>Deſpair,</hi> and ſo are hopeleſs of ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what they ſee and admire. In all theſe flaſhings, the Truths of God paſs by them, as Water through a Conduit, and leave a Dew, but ſoak not, as Water into the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is demanded, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe which are called according to purpoſe, go beyond all others in this Wilderneſs of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it ſhould be ſimply and in all things a common work to thoſe which are outwardly called only, with thoſe which are inwardly called alſo, that good and bad are brought alike into this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> that thoſe which attain Grace, and thoſe which attain none, ſhould be brought to lie under one degree of Legal Preparation is ſtrange to aſſert; ſeeing it is the ſame Spirit under divers names, that firſt prepareth by bringing into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> as the <hi>Spirit of Bondage;</hi> and then infuſeth Grace by ſpeaking unto the Heart, as <hi>the Spirit of Adoption:</hi> As alſo conſidering, it is a promiſe made here in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Church, and to her appropriated.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205125:42"/> Yet it will be granted here, to be difficult to ſatisfie any, or to ſhew demonſtratively wherein they differ. Only for the preſent take what may be offered that way, till ſome other by ſearching the Matter, ſhall give more and clearer Light for plainer diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe then, that are ſpecially beloved of God, and whoſe ſafety the Lord doth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely aim at and intend, go beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this Work in theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the intent and purpoſe of God; which is not to Civilize, or only to Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize them, as he deals with many; bringing them into trouble, to tame and keep them in order, for the good of humane Society; but indeed to go through with them, for their ſound Humiliation, and through San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the ſucceſs and event; for ſome are only terrified and reſtrained for a time, when others are heartily grieved, even drencht in Sorrow, to be ſavingly renewed after: So that the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification</hi> doth immediately after manifeſt both Preſence and Power, Victory and Sovereignty. But who doubteth of this? Is there no other way wherein they differ? Yes, and it may be thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Modo operationis,</hi> in the manner of Working. <hi>Some</hi> are brought in by outward means only, (the Law, Sickneſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:205125:42"/> Croſſes; as the Marble is ſaid to ſweat in foul Weather, but ſtill remains Marble) aſſiſted and followed with the common light and power of Natural Conſcience; <hi>others</hi> are brought in, not without the Holy Ghoſt, ordering the outward means and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſight, to continue cloſed, till this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Work be perfected: As the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> by his Love in Electing before they had a Being, except in the Divine Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo the bleſſed <hi>Spirit</hi> taketh hold upon them by his Power, ſo ſoon as they have any Being; which hold of his is diverſly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, both in reſpect of time, means, and manner of Working: Towards ſome at one time, by one means, and after this manner; towards others at another time by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinance, and after another manner: By degrees drawing them into this <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> where he diſcovereth their natural Bondage, ſtirreth them to deſire, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them how to attain true Liberty. 2. <hi>In duratione &amp; diſparitate diſpoſitionis:</hi> In their continuance and diſſimilitude of Diſpoſition, while they are there. Thoſe that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to Life, do continue there common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly longer: Not for intermitted Hours, to be now in and then out, but for Days, Weeks, Months, Years; never wholly off, till they paſs <hi>Jordan,</hi> and arrive to their heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Some have been ſenſibly kept there, the moſt time of their Life, and yet come
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205125:43"/> off well in the end. Beſides, they are more kindled, and deeply affected with an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and loathing of all Sin; their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is more lively and feelingly bent upon Purity, hungring and thirſting after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and their hope is ſtronger, that it may be, that it will be better with them. For this is that ſecret Staff, which ſupporteth ſuch Travellers. They deſire pardon, and they hope they ſhall have it; they <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs,</hi> [which others in this caſe never do] and have ſome hope to be ſatisfied: They long to hear the Voice, and ſee the loving Countenance of Chriſt, and are inwardly upheld with hope of both: Who can tell, ſay they in their Hearts, but that the Lord may be intreated to turn away his fierce Anger, that we periſh not here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our deſert? It is our ſelf-harming league with Sin, that the Lord goeth about to break; were that done, he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nor be angry for ever: When we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto him, he will ſpeak unto us, as he did unto <hi>Hagar;</hi> however, we muſt truſt in him, although he ſhould kill us with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt, in this vaſt and deſolate <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> of legal Terror and Conviction, where no refreſhing Streams do flow.</p>
                     <p>Uſe 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> may be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, both to Miniſters and People. Firſt, To <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that they wiſely endeavour it, to bring their People into and through this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205125:43"/> 
                        <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> by preſenting and preſſing the <hi>Law,</hi> which is God's Inſtrument to charge Sin upon the Soul, in the true Nature, Root and Fruit thereof; God having imparted ſome of his own Brightneſs and Power unto it, for this end. To know how the Law doth this, may give ſome Light to Miniſters in the uſe thereof: And that may be, 1. By way of Illumination of the Underſtanding, to ſee Sin as it is ſin, which no word nor means in the World can do beſide; becauſe God hath imparted to it the brightneſs of his own Purity, [ſo much as he pleaſed, and thought to be needful for this end] with a ſearching faculty, undeniably to charge Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with all, and every Sin; this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſplendor cloſing with the innate light of Conſcience, proceeding in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, to diſcover <hi>Actual</hi> Sins, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning often with ſome of the moſt hainous; and going on by degrees to the reſt, for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and nature, how many, how foul; and to that end the Law preſenteth to the Soul,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> With her <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> for Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Commiſſion; being made and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by him who is infinite in every Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and hath an abſolute dominion over our Bodies and Spirits, and ſent abroad with a large Commiſſion, to ſhow all Sins unto all ſorts impartially; whether they be high or low, rich or poor, prophane or holy; the Law hath a ſoveraign power, and exerciſeth it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:205125:44"/> after a regal manner, ſparing none.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> With her Integrity, and Extent. In this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> the Law ſheweth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience her <hi>Spiritual Authority,</hi> her <hi>Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Faculties,</hi> her <hi>exact Purity,</hi> and that mutual <hi>Dependency,</hi> one Law, and one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Law hath upon another. Her <hi>Spiritual Authority;</hi> to go into the inward Rooms, yea, into every corner of thoſe Rooms, and every crevice of thoſe Corners, where Sin lieth hid, and to ſearch and bring out all Sins, great and ſmall, of Omiſſion and Commiſſion. Like a two-edged Sword, it pierceth to the very Marrow, to the very intents of the Hearts. Her <hi>Aggravating Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> to ſet forth particular Sins to the Eye, as the Glaſs doth the ſpots of the Face, in the moſt odious Colours, that ſo Sin may appear exceeding ſinful. Her <hi>Exact Purity,</hi> to diſcover ſuch practices of our Life to be ſinful, which we never dreamt of, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took notice of, ſo much as to ſuſpect. <hi>I had not known Sin, (i. e.)</hi> ſome Sins to be Sins, <hi>but by the Law;</hi> this diſcovers that to be a Mountain, which before the Sinner judged to be a Mote, and that to be Sin, which before he eſteemed Righteouſneſs; and like a Light, expoſed to view thoſe Corruptions which lay hid and unſeen, in their due proportion. Her <hi>Mutual Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> one Branch doth ſo hang upon another, that whoſoever breaketh one, is guilty of all,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:205125:44"/> 
                        <hi>James</hi> 2.10. The whole Law is but one Copulative; and this dependance of one Precept with another, and all upon the Law-Maker, [whoſe Authority is violated and contemned in the breach of one, as well as of all] occaſioneth, even one Sin to be ſo infinitly weighty. Secondly, The Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to diſcover <hi>Original Sin,</hi> in the Root and Branches; how we participate in the firſt ſinful Act of <hi>Adam;</hi> how that Guilt is imputed, and how Habitual Corruption is propagated from immediate Parents to all their Poſterity, proceeding from them by an ordinary way of Generation, as Poyſon is carried from the Fountain to the Ciſtern; all herent in the Nature, or redounding on the Perſon, by virtue of the Covenant; and this the Law doth, either by way of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,</hi> or elſe by way of poſitive <hi>Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; comparing</hi> and preferring it for the evil thereof to Actual Sin, as the Root or Cauſe thereof; <hi>Et quod efficit tale, eſt magis tale,</hi> is ſaid in Philoſophy, and is true in Divinity: Then <hi>deſcribing</hi> it either by Names, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: By <hi>Names</hi> firſt, calling it the <hi>Old Man,</hi> the <hi>Body of Death,</hi> (as if Death were nothing without this Sin) a <hi>Weight</hi> that <hi>preſſeth down,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>Properties</hi> next; and they are eſpecially four, <hi>viz.</hi> Eminency, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy, Inſenſibility, and Perpetuity. For <hi>Eminency,</hi> the Law ſaith it is a Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Evil, and the worſt of all Evils. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy;</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:205125:45"/> ſtrangely to rule and overſway, like a ſecond Nature, which Men often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, while they ſay, It is their Nature to do this or that, is to be furious, to ſwear and curſe a little now and then, they cannot help it; 'tis their Nature, when indeed it is the corruption of Nature reigning. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility,</hi> to keep all the parts in a ſleepy peace, that Men are not aware of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger till they be awakened and brought into this <hi>Wilderneſs. Perpetuity;</hi> to cleave faſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Nature, even to the end of our Life. While Blood is in our Veins, Sin is in our Nature; like the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> this remains as a Thorn in the ſide, in the Fleſh; even when Victory is obtained by Grace, over all Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sin in a competent meaſure, that is ſtill living and ſtirring, gathering new Forces, and breaking into Rebellion ever and anon. Thus the Law bringeth Men into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs by the work of Illumination. 2. By the work of <hi>Conviction,</hi> whereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is brought to this Spiritual aſſent, that the former Teſtimony of the Law is true, both for Crime, Object, and Curſe denounced; and the Perſon to a particular application, both of the <hi>Sins</hi> to be <hi>perſonal,</hi> and of the <hi>ſentence</hi> againſt ſuch Sins and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be <hi>Legal:</hi> The ſum of which Work may be compriſed in this practical Syllogiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> Whoſoever is thus Sinful and Curſed according to the Law, is fully miſerable;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:205125:45"/> but I (ſaith the aſſuming Conſcience) am thus ſinful and curſed, therefore I am fully miſerable. What ſhall I do, miſerable Man that I am? who ſhall deliver me in this vaſt <hi>Wilderneſs?</hi> O help, help me for the Lord's ſake, I am ready to faint, to ſink, to die with fear and grief.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit by the Miniſtry of the Law worketh this diſtinct and ſound Conviction divers ways:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By removing all Impediments, which are uſually obſerved to hinder this Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. One is <hi>natural Deadneſs</hi> and <hi>penal Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> cauſed by Love and Cuſtom in ſome one or many Sins, which, while it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed between the Law and Conſcience, will not ſuffer them to cloſe; and ſo nothing is done till that be in part removed. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Spiritual Sloth,</hi> which is a prevailing Backwardneſs, and a precipitating Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to conſider what the Law diſcovereth, and concludeth againſt Sin. Men naturally love their eaſe and quiet, they would not be diſturbed. A third is <hi>carnal Craft,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Religion, and to perform all outward Duties, and yet all the while to keep Sin in the Heart untouch'd, to remain as habitually and delightfully unclean as ever.</p>
                     <p>This Soul-deſtroying Subtilty appears, 1. In a readineſs to ſhift off Sin and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs from our ſelves to others. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter met with ſuch an one to day, there was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:205125:46"/> a Leſſon for him indeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. In loathing a ſound plain-ſearching Miniſtry, (as ſore Eyes do the Sun) which goes about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the Objections of a natural Heart againſt the Goodneſs of Divine Truth. Thus the Law removes Impediments.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It worketh Conviction, by applying unto the Soul and Conſcience,</p>
                     <p n="1">[1.] Gentle Expoſtulations, frequently and movingly here and there; as unto <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Gehazi, Gen.</hi> 3.9. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5.26. Tell me, poor Soul, was it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Confeſs thy Sin, eaſe thy ſelf, and give glory to God. O how loving is the Lord, even in his Terrors and Enditements! In the midſt of Judgment he remembreth Mercy. Tho his Robes be red, they are not without ſome ſtreamings of white; and if he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to pronounce Judgment, as it was ſaid of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he doth it even with Tears in his Eyes.</p>
                     <p n="2">[2.] Inſtances very pertinent, and thoſe either <hi>direct,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</hi> As <hi>Nathan</hi> dealt with <hi>David,</hi> ſo the Lord deals with thoſe whom he intends to reſtrain and renew. You are the Men, ſaith he, that have been ſo much addicted to, and delighted with Idleneſs, Wantonneſs, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Slandring, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Swearing, Lying, and the like.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:205125:46"/>[3.] Threatnings are added where the former avail not. <hi>Curſed is every one that doth not all which is written in the Law.</hi> He ſhall be purſued with Judgments of divers Natures to one end, ſometimes with proſperity on the right, and anon with adverſity on the left hand; and laſt of all, which is the worſt of all, dying impenitently, he muſt needs be damned. Thus the Lord thundereth in his Law againſt ſome, whom nevertheleſs he intends to ſanctify and ſave; as a Father may threaten and terrify that Child whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make his Heir. But withal you muſt know, that he doth inwardly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſupport them, that they daſh not upon Preſumption, nor ſink under final Deſpair. So that at length being driven from all their hiding Places, they are brought into this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and forced freely to take upon themſelves all thoſe Sins diſcovered by the Law, to fall down before God, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their Guilt and Deſert before the Throne of his Majeſty, reſolving there to lie proſtrate till he raiſe them in Mercy. Now ſay they, we ſee, we feel, we know, how true the Word of God is; how faithfully ſuch Miniſters dealt with us, while we ſlighted and laughed them to ſcorn; and how deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sin is, that appears at firſt ſmall, ſweet, and clean, when as it is weighty, bitter, and filthy. They cry, who will take this Dagger out of my Heart? this Mill-ſtone off my Back?

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:205125:47"/> when the Lord is about to bring them into it. Eye them, that you may avoid them. For inſtance, to eſteem of the Law as a <hi>ſtrange thing,</hi> as not appertaining to them, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are little or nothing concerned; to interpoſe ſome beloved Sin between theſe two Lights of the Law and Conſcience, that they cannot join. This alone hindered <hi>Herod</hi>'s Converſion under <hi>John</hi>'s piercing Miniſtry, the interpoſition of his <hi>Herodias</hi> cauſed a fearful and final Eclipſe. So likewiſe to go away unthankfully and careleſly from a good Diſcourſe, doth hinder the Work, and quench the Sparks which might have bred a Flame.</p>

                     <p n="1">(1.) Upon the Mercies of God beſtowed upon you in particular from time to time. This Courſe the Lord took to humble <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9. And whoſoever hath tried will ſay, It is a very piercing way to bring the Heart into a through and kindly grief. I have read of one, who reading a Pardon ſent him from the King, fell a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and burſt out into theſe Words, <hi>A Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don hath done that which Death could not do; it hath made my Heart to relent.</hi> As the Sugar-Loaf is diſſolved, and weeps it ſelf away, when it is dipp'd in Wine: ſo will Penitents diſſolve, and melt themſelves away in the ſweet ſence of Divine Love, and their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or abuſe of it. Without doubt the very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:205125:48"/> Behaviour of the <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s Father brake his Heart with more thawings and kindly mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than ever his former Hardſhip and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did. O this! that ever he ſhould run to meet him! that he ſhould fall upon his Neck, and kiſs him! This kindneſs of his Lips wounded his Heart with the deeper ſence and judging of his own unkindneſs. When the Surface of the Water is glazed with Ice, the Sun-beams diſſolve it: ſuch operation hath the Grace of Chriſt upon frozen Hearts, which are never truly melted into Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by Evangelical Beams. Surely when a Sinner ſhall conſider the great Love, the ſweeteſt Kindneſs, the freeſt Pardons offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the choiceſt Mercies beſtowed, his Heart cannot but melt into a River. What, all theſe to and for me, Lord? yea, for thee: What, after ſuch deep Rebellions and Refuſals? yea, after all, and that moſt freely and willingly. Good Lord! how can the Soul but weep and mourn now!</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Meditate for that purpoſe upon the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, able to <hi>revenge the Quarrel of his Covenant,</hi> and to bruiſe all his proud and ſtout Enemies with a <hi>Rod of Iron.</hi> He is not only a Rock of Refuge to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo a Rock of Deſtruction to daſh the Impenitent in pieces. The ſtrength of the Rock is ſeen, as in upholding the Houſe that is built upon it; ſo in breaking the Ships that daſh againſt it. The force of Fire is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:205125:48"/> manifeſted, as in refining the Gold, ſo in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the Droſs. <hi>There is none like unto thee, O Lord; thou art great; and thy Name is great; who would not fear thee, thou King of Nations?</hi> Jer. 10.6. And, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God,</hi> Heb. 10.31. <hi>As a Lion, he tears in pieces the Adverſaries,</hi> Pſal. 50.22. There is no ſtanding before him, if his <hi>Wrath be kindled, though but a little.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) Meditate upon ſinful Nature, there is both Guilt and Filth, ſuch a Nature which Sighs and Tears may better expreſs than Words. We were in <hi>Adam</hi> as in a common Root, and he ſinning, we became guilty: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>In whom all have ſinned.</hi> By his Treaſon our Blood is tainted, and this Guilt brings Shame with it, as its Twin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. And not only is the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin imputed, but the Poiſon of his Nature is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated to us; our Virgin-Nature is defiled, the Heart is ſpotted, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.38. How then can the Actions be pure? If the Water be foul in the Well, it cannot be clean in the Bucket. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing.</hi> Hell it ſelf, which is the ſole Receptacle of Sin and Sinners, is not in ſome reſpect more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than Mans Nature. Poor Man is like a Patient under the Phyſician's hands, that hath no ſound part, his Head bruiſed, his Liver ſwelled, his Lungs periſhed, his Blood enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his Feet gangren'd. Thus it is before
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:205125:49"/> Grace comes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6. Yea, though your Nature be changed, there are Remainders of this Corruption. The beſt Saint alive, who is taken out of the Grave of Sin, yet ſmells of the Grave-clothes ſtill upon him. As <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid of the Roſe, that it was a fair Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but it wanted not its Prickles, that might put him in mind of the Curſe the Earth was ſubject unto; ſo in the beſt there are thoſe Remainders and Relicks of Sin, which might cauſe them to mourn and weep before the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) Meditate on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Suffering, Agony, how ſharp and bitter it was, [if your Heart be as hard as an <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> the Blood of this <hi>Scape-goat</hi> will ſoften it]: It affected his <hi>Head,</hi> for upon the fore-ſight he began to be amazed, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33. It affected his <hi>Heart,</hi> for he began to droop, to faint, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.37. See how he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in his Soul, (the innocent for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) it was overcaſt with an heavineſs to death; yea, in his Body, he <hi>ſweat drops of Blood,</hi> Luke 22.44. Meditate on his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſee if they will not move you to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The ſight of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s bloody Robes greatly affected the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to revenge. When St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> read the Story of <hi>Dido,</hi> he could not but weep: And when <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſaw <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Head, tho his Enemy, he wept, and refuſed at his return to <hi>Rome</hi> to ride in Triumph for his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205125:49"/> Victory. The like did <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th upon his great Victory over the <hi>French</hi> King at the Siege of <hi>Paris.</hi> How much more may the Meditation of Chriſt's Sufferings, who was our Friend, ſuffering for our Sins, melt our Hearts? See him in the <hi>Wilderneſs of Suffering,</hi> it may bring you into the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sorrow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) Meditate upon the dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, if you have not Sin charged upon you here in this Life. If you follow not God into this <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of Trouble for Sin now, but ſtill cleave to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> preferring the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany Pleaſures of Sin to this <hi>Manna,</hi> be aſſured one of theſe two Evils will follow, either the Lord will break this League and Union between Sin and your Hearts, or elſe he will permit and order that Diſorder, till you attain the fulneſs of Hardneſs and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When Conſcience ſhall be awakened, and Sin charged upon the Soul ſuddenly and fully, both for number and weight, your jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Meetings, exceſſive Drinkings, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Quaffings, will have weeping and howling here or hereafter; when it will not be the whole World on Fire, nor the terrible preſence of the Judg, coming with ſhrill-ſounding Trumpets, and Troops of Angels only, nor Hell and all the Devils there, ſhall be ſo fearfully heavy and unſupportable; but Sin ſo deceitfully pleaſing now, appearing then more ugly than Hell, or the fouleſt Fiend
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:205125:50"/> there; committed now by degrees, one after another, ſome this Day, more next, now an Oath, than a Lye, but preſented and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and imputed altogether, even to the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Soul. O think of this often, all you in whom the cuſtom of Sinning hath taken away the ſence of Sinning! if any thing, this will help to awaken and bring you into this <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. You may help the Work forward, by ſpecial application of what you hear; when the Law is perſonally applied, the legal work upon the matter is ended; and when the Goſpel is believed, the whole is perfected. As it was in the Creation of the World, and in the Conception of Chriſt, [ſo ſoon as ever his bleſſed Virgin-Mother did cloſe by her underſtanding and will with the Word and Meſſage of the Angel, the Hypoſtatical Union was begun in her Womb; as <hi>Zanchy</hi> following <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion] ſo it is in the Regeneration, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental nutrition of the new Man, he ſaid it was done; no ſooner is the Word applied, but the Work is wrought. Put it not off therefore to others, but ſay, Certainly this is my caſe, I am the Man, that have done ſo and ſo; that have ſuch an Heart, ſo hard, ſo unclean and deceitful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then hear what threatnings are denounced againſt ſuch Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205125:50"/> will pluck the Plumes, and allay the Jollity of any Perſon. This is the way to draw proud Minions, and roaring Gallants, out of their Fools Paradiſe, into a World of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving trouble, to ſee and bewail their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Vanities and youthful Folly. And here let all ſuch be adviſed to ſtay, till the Lord be pleaſed to ſpeak unto them, and to bring them as by a Hand of Comfort into <hi>Canaan.</hi> O pluck not off the Plaſter becauſe it ſmarts; refuſe not the Potion becauſe it is bitter; confine your ſelves to his Rules of Phyſick; break not thoſe Bonds, and caſt not off theſe Cords from you; haſte not out of this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs too ſoon, becauſe it is Solitary; the end and iſſue will ſupport Patience; he that believes will not make haſte to apply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Comforts. The Lord will be ſeen <hi>in the Mount,</hi> and heard in the cool of the Day. The Corroſive muſt eat out Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the bottom, before any healing Salve can well be applied, that ſo there may be a perfect Cure: The <hi>Law</hi> is that Corroſive, promiſes that healing Oyl; both muſt have their time and place for Working: O let not, let not prepoſterous haſte prevent good ſpeed, be more deſirous to be ready for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, than to have it; and then doubt not but it will be enjoyed time enough.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:205125:51"/> therein a ſwarm of <hi>Bees</hi> with ſweet Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, yieldeth ſweet Conſolation to ſuch as have been, or at preſent are exerciſed in this uncomfortable condition. <hi>No Affliction is for the preſent joyous, but rather greivous:</hi> Eſpecially, <hi>a wounded Conſcience who can bear?</hi> To be alone in a vaſt <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Sins, with divers and horrid Fears; and which is heavieſt of all, to have the Wrath of the <hi>Almighty</hi> preſented to a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Soul, no Friend in ſight, but all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Enemies to him; this is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Caſe: Yet here is comfort for all this; if the Eye be once opened as <hi>Hagar</hi>'s was, or the Servants of the Prophet, to ſee a <hi>Fountain</hi> near us <hi>opened for Sin and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to ſee the Mountains covered with arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souldiers, and Chariots of Fire on our ſide; if we once look up and conſider the end which the Lord propoſeth in ſo doing, it will never after be ſo doleful: he can lead you through the Sea, feed you in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> and eaſily limit and deſtroy all your Enemies. Nay, in time, he will do it: And if the Lord be on our ſide, we need not fear ten Thouſands homming us in on every ſide.</p>
                     <p>Many there be in the World to whom this Comfort belongs, who will not take it; and they run into two Extremes; either ſuch who have drunken ſo deep of this Cup of Legal Terror, that they judg themſelves
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:205125:51"/> hated of God, as if none of his Beloved had ever been in that Caſe; when as his own dear Son was ſo far brought into this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> as to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And here it is a merciful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made unto a beloved People, an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courſe which he doth take with thoſe that are dear unto him; <hi>through many Tribulations</hi> to bring them into poſſeſſion of a Kingdom. Let not Satan, nor your own ſlaviſh Fears, ſo far prepoſſeſs you, as to deny audience unto God, when he ſhall be pleaſed to ſpeak unto our Hearts. Or elſe they are ſuch who have had either none or ſo little of it in their apprehenſions, that they deem themſelves ſtill in the State of Nature, becauſe they were never humbled enough, as ſuch and ſuch; they were never in this Wilderneſs, and ſo conſequently never yet in the ready way to Heaven. Therefore they refuſe Chriſt, and all Comfort offered: no Promiſe, they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them.</p>
                     <p>To ſuch I would ſay, True it is, that all ordinary Converts are humbled, all are brought into this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and all taſte more or leſs at one time or other of this Cup of Legal Terrour. The Soul that is ſo prone to Sin muſt be ſtayed, Conſcience muſt be charged with the guilt and weight of Sin, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deſerved Anger from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till the Soul be weary of Sin, and the Party oft-times ſo afraid, that he dares
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:205125:52"/> not be alone, and yet finds little eaſe in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But then you muſt know withal, that the Lord is a free Agent, he hath not limited himſelf to one degree or meaſure; ſo neither can any Man ſet a ſtint, to ſay, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall be ſaved muſt be humbled to this and this degree. God cannot be tract in his goings, none can find out his Footſteps: <hi>His ways are paſt finding out;</hi> they are like the <hi>way of an Eagle in the Air.</hi> Beſides, all need it not alike, and he works it diverſly upon moſt, according to the number, nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their Sins, and with reference to that Emploiment he intends them for after; as hath been formerly noted.</p>
                     <p>A familiar Inſtance may ſerve to bring the meaning hereof to every Capacity. Of Locks ſome are new, and eaſily opened; others old and ruſty, and muſt with violence be broken open; of Stones ſome are harder than others: So of Perſons, ſome are more glued unto, and faſter riveted in Sin, than others. <hi>Paul</hi> was knock'd down, while <hi>Lydia</hi> had her Heart gently opened. <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> a Publican and Extortioner, is not ſtricken from the Tree which he climbs, by any Rays of Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhining upon him; but is like ripe Fruit gathered by the Hand, not ſhaken off by the tempeſtuous Winds. If an old Adulterer, or a deboiſt lewd Companion, be once brought into this Wilderneſs, he is dreadfully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his foul Sins purſue him like <hi>Acteon</hi>'s
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:205125:52"/> Hounds, Hell-fire ſeems to flie in his Eyes, and he fears ſinking every moment. Such as have taken much delight in Sin, are made for their health to vomit up their ſweet Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with much bitterneſs. O my Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, crieth out one in ſuch a place, and with ſuch Company! O my Fornication and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with ſuch and ſuch, ſaith another! Once pleaſant, now bitter as Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood: Wo unto us, that ever we were born, to go on ſo long in Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that by this time all the Town and Country hear and ſpeak of them; ſuch a Change cannot eſcape won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Thus the Caſe is difficult with ſome. As a Diſeaſe come to a Paroxiſm is hardly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And as where the Enemy is ſtronger, there the Victory is more difficult. Now for others, who have been by careful Parents more reſtrainedly brought up, and religiouſly educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they may be brought into it ſoftly and by degrees, not knowing when or how; thus far they are come, they hate Sin, all, in all ſorts; they love Grace and good Company, God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they prize above all Contentments, loving and cleaving unto Jeſus Chriſt with ſincere Hearts; good Duties they perform, and dare not often omit them in private or in public; and a good Conſcience they deſire to keep towards God and Man; they are the ſame in words and deeds, to the exacteſt of their care and ſincere intention; charitable to the Poor, <hi>doing good to all, eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> This
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205125:53"/> they know, but that they were ever in this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> they remember not. Many times, and unto many Perſons, the Lord hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the violence of this Terror, knowing their weak and tender diſpoſition, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them a ſaving Proportion by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; it is long upon them that have leaſt, and of ſhorter continuance in them that have moſt: Let none meaſure themſelves by others. A wiſe Phyſician proportioneth his Receit to the Conſtitution of the Patient, elſe he might ſooner kill than cure. Who will ſay, his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can do him no good, becauſe he had not ſo many drams as another had, when as his Body would not bear it, neither doth his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe require it? The Lord knoweth beſt what he hath to do, and how. Leave it to him, and look rather to the <hi>Quality,</hi> than to the <hi>Quantity;</hi> that you be utterly driven out of your ſelves, to reſt effectually on Chriſt, as your Lord and Saviour, and then fear not.</p>
                     <p>Queſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But how may a Man know, whether he have been at any time brought into this Wilderneſs in truth?</hi>

Neither would God have the Wounds of Godly Sorrow to be ſo cloſed up, as not to bleed afreſh upon every good occaſion. And this Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may be diſcerned from all counterfeit daſhes of Hypocritical and Vain-glorious Mourning. Thus:</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

By a reſtleſs hatred of Sin, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen: It is as fearful and odious now, as the Devil was heretofore: His Eye and Hand are toward it, his deſire and endeavour is to have it diſcover'd and kill'd, reſolving to do and ſuffer any thing rather than to ſin; give him any Plague, except the plague of an hard, unclean Heart: He hateth Sin, not only in the publick acts, which might ſhame him; but alſo in ſecret thoughts, which might ſtain and defile him. The vengeance of Sin is not only frightful, but the venom of Sin is diſtaſtful; he fears Corruption, not only as it is a Fire burning, but as it is a Coal that is blacking.</p>
                     <p>Further, This Work may be known by Fruits and Effects of it. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it be right, it is followed with a full and free confeſſion of Sin: The Perſon that is in a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi>-condition, confeſſeth more than all the World know, or can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of. As the ſenſible Sick-man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth all his Diſtempers to the Phyſician, he reſteth not in generals, but deſcendeth to particulars.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205125:55"/> And all to this end, that themſelves may be the more aſhamed, and God the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But may not Wicked, Graceleſs Men make confeſſion of Sin?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes; for <hi>Judas</hi> did, and others may alſo: But ſee the difference. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to Men, but not to God, and by his confeſſion ſought only to eaſe his Heart: As Drunkards by Vomiting rid their Stomachs. Thus, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> relates it, <hi>Chronico. p.</hi> 5. <hi>Latomus</hi> of <hi>Lovain</hi> confeſſed, <hi>Inter horrendos mugitus ſe contra Conſcientiam adverſatum eſſe veritati:</hi> Roaring and crying out, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience he had perſecuted the Truth of God. In trouble of Mind all will out. Conſcience, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Wife, will not conceal the Riddle: Like <hi>Fulvia,</hi> a whoriſh Woman, who declared all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of her fooliſh Lover <hi>Cneius,</hi> a noble <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> But theſe Confeſſions of Graceleſs Men are not from the concurrence of a judicious active Will, but rather, as the ſparkles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Colliſion of Flints, elicited by the impreſſions of appearing and urging Evils: Like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s obedience, forced from Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and nothing elſe; as that of ſome <hi>Mariners</hi> in a Storm, who in the Calm, turn as wicked as before; and court the return of thoſe Goods they caſt out in a Tempeſtuous ſeaſon, when the Winds are ſilenced.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is accompanied with Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for Sin. The true penitent hath a County <hi>Palatinate</hi> within his Boſom, and arraigns and judges himſelf. <hi>Abraham</hi> crys out, <hi>I am but duſt and aſhes:</hi> Duſt minds us of Mortality, Aſhes of Fire; as if he had deſerved both. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy Mercies,</hi> Gen. 32.10. The <hi>Centurion, I am unworthy thou ſhouldſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Roof.</hi> St. <hi>Peter, Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a ſinful Man.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> in our <hi>Martyrologie, Lord, I am Hell, thou art Heaven; I a ſink of Sin, thou a Fount of Grace.</hi> This is one chief part of Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, to acknowledg that the utmoſt Wrath and Severity of God, is juſtly due to ſuch Sins as we have committed. For tho gracious Perſons by their Sins do not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become ſubject to the Wrath of God and his Vengeance, yet they meritoriouſly make ſuch Perſons liable to Death; ſo that a true Penitent under the apprehenſions of his Sins, may ſay truly, as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> did, <hi>I am no more worthy to be called thy Son!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The practice and courſe of Sin is ſtayed; no more Swearing, no more wanton Dalliance, no more drunken Meetings. Tho he cannot but ſin, yet he doth not <hi>will</hi> Sin: It is not his Trade; yea, all the ways and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ans are cut off, which did, or might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, or ſuccour Corruption. As <hi>Generals</hi> do in beſieging a Town or Caſtle, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:205125:56"/> them of all ſuch ways and means, whereby they might provide for themſelves: Or as the Men of <hi>Abel</hi> dealt with <hi>Sheba</hi> the Son of <hi>Bichri,</hi> they cut off his Head, and caſt it over to <hi>Joab,</hi> that he might depart, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.22. So did <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19.8. in reſtitution and contribution, he pulled down the tents of Sin: And as <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> dealt with her wanton Eyes and whoriſh Locks, ſhe wept Rivers of Tears with the one, and wiped our Saviour's Feet with the other: Loth to have done ſo before. It is uſual with Men that would deſtroy the brood of ſome Beaſts and Birds, they pull down their Neſts, and deſtroy their Dens: So it is with the true Penitent in reſpect of Sin; down with all now, that they would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There followeth a great Love to a ſound-ſearching Miniſtry, that will fully ſearch and try the deceitful Heart, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deceitful holds of Sin. <hi>Threatnings</hi> are welcome, that ſhake the proud, ſtony Heart, and daſh <hi>Babels</hi> Brats againſt the Wall; I mean the crawling Vermin of noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Luſts. O ſtrike, thou Man of God, ſtrike in Chriſt's Name, and ſpare not, burn and cut here; O here is an impure, hard Heart, as ever was harboured in any Breaſt! And then goeth moſt chearfully, moſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and beſt contented, when he is ſtruck to the quick: What a bleſſed opportunity
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:205125:56"/> was this, happy that I lived to ſee this day, to hear ſuch a Sermon. If we hate an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nothing will ſatisfie but his death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There remains ſtill many fears, and an holy jealouſie, that every Sin he reades or hears of, is his; <hi>Maſter is it I?</hi> As it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that when he walked in the Streets and ſaw any Perſon diſorder'd, would ſay to himſelf, <hi>Am I ſuch a one?</hi> And as Maſter <hi>Bradford</hi> did, when he looked into the lewd Lives of others: And ſo do all humble Chriſtians. Nay, commonly, in this caſe he takes all to himſelf; I have been this, and I am thus, and deſerve that: He needs neither Accuſer, nor Judg, but is ready to caſt the firſt ſtone at himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus the intented Convert is brought into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of Spiritual Trouble, where he yet remains a miſerable Spectacle, in Chains under Bondage, toſſing to and fro, ſighing and looking about, now upon <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> where he ſeeth his Chains, but no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to looſe them; then <hi>abroad</hi> to ſee if there be any near; but there is none to hear or help: Finally, he raiſeth up his Eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, in ſuch an earneſt, humble, fixed manner, as if he would never leave, till he heard ſome word of comfort; for which here is a Promiſe, which comes in the next place to be handled.</p>

As it was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when God gave the Law to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> they heard the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſaw the Lightning, but neither heard nor ſaw God; ſo it is in this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive work of Faith, Men ſee the bright pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Law, they hear many Woes and Curſes denounced, but God in Chriſt they neither hear nor ſee, till he further enlighten them, and raiſe them up by ſpeaking to their Hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſpeak <hi>Victoriouſly;</hi> above all the ſtrength of that natural reſiſtability which is in every untamed and unſanctified Heart.

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> God ſpeaketh and worketh after a ſecret, if not an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible manner: Divine Graces curiouſly and myſteriouſly inſinuate themſelves, and the impreſſions of the Will are extremely nice: Therefore Men ſhould not be raſh in determining, nor over-bold in preſenting to the Eye, what God hath vailed; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:205125:58"/> to make Windows in God's Cloſet, and to unclaſp his ſecret Books. St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>'s Rule is ſurely ſafe; <hi>Praeſtat dubitare de occultis, quam de incertis litigare.</hi> And his Counſel is very prudent, <hi>viz.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Man hath certainly loſt his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Good, by his firſt choice of Evil. <hi>Seipſum perdit &amp; liberum arbitrium,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> hath it.

Though ſome kind of Freedom cannot be denied to be eſſential and unſeparable from the Will. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this power of Man as in the lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he is not <hi>naturally</hi> but <hi>morally</hi> dead, and as a dead Man is not able to produce any Vital Actions, ſo neither can any natural Man produce any Spiritual Action. <hi>Quid boni operari poteſt perditus, niſi quantum fuit à perditione liberatus?

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:205125:59"/> in the uſe and exerciſe thereof; as will appear in the ſequel; only firſt obſerve the contents of this Promiſe, as it may be drawn out into two Theological Concluſions, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is the Heart which is chiefly wrought upon, in the work of Converſion.</hi> Call it the Heart, the Will, or the inner Man, or what elſe; it is that within us, which no Inſtrument nor finite Power can reach unto: And herein this differeth from the former Work; the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> was chiefly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that, the <hi>Will</hi> in this; which is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a King, with all the reſt of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Faculties and Senſes. A <hi>good Will</hi> is the <hi>good Tree,</hi> that maketh the <hi>Fruit good;</hi> and a <hi>bad Will</hi> is the <hi>bad Tree,</hi> that maketh the <hi>Fruit bad.</hi> As all the evil or good of a Tree cometh from the Root, ſo doth all the evil or good of a Man come from his <hi>Will;</hi> and till this be ſanctified, till this be renewed, nothing can be good in him. The Eyes may look, the Tongue may talk, and the Feet may in Men's apprehenſions be moving towards Heaven, and yet the <hi>Heart</hi> all the while may be bent Hell-ward: As Men rowing in a Boat, look one way, but drive a contrary Courſe, and intend another way: The outward Man may be ſeemingly Converted, without any ſaving change in the inward, but the <hi>inner Man</hi> cannot be long without the other; as the Candle in the Lanthorn will appear by its own Light; and as the Diamond, or rich
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:205125:60"/> Jewel, will caſt a ſparkling Luſtre, ſooner or later before the Eyes of others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Gracious Lord and Wiſe Phyſician, takes the ſureſt and ſoundeſt way to work a perfect Cure. Give him the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the reſt will quickly follow. It is the Heart that is <hi>hard;</hi> by ſpeaking to it, he <hi>ſoftens</hi> it; it is the Heart that is <hi>unclean,</hi> by ſpeaking to it, he <hi>ſanctifieth</hi> it; it is the Heart that is <hi>poor,</hi> by ſpeaking he doth <hi>inrich</hi> it; it is the Heart that is <hi>diſtreſſed,</hi> with fears and doubts, by ſpeaking unto, he <hi>comforteth</hi> and confirmeth it; it is the Heart that is moſt out of <hi>order,</hi> by ſpeaking to, he brings it into a <hi>ſpiritual frame.</hi> Ezek. 36.25, 26. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean Water upon you, and you ſhall be clean.— A new Heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thus the truth of this Point ſhineth with its own Luſtre. We will paſs from it with the reſolution of a Caſe here to be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz. All this I believe, may ſome Perſon ſay, but how may I diſcern when my Heart is thus wrought upon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When it is <hi>tender;</hi> not in the preſent act or exerciſe of Hearing only, but after, while you meditate on your <hi>Sins,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned.</hi> He doth even drown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Tears: Or, upon God's <hi>Mercies</hi> in Chriſt, upon any relation of the <hi>Churches di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,</hi> at Home or Abroad, not only as they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:205125:60"/> are Men, but as they are Members of Chriſt; both being melting Conſiderations; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bring the Heart to this temper, but the fulfilling of this promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When it cloſeth with God's <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> together; deſirous to do the one, as delighted to believe the other. Where true Converſion is wrought, the <hi>Will</hi> is maſter'd, of unwilling is made willing; and ready to chuſe what it once abhorred. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Now the Heart makes a ſtand at nothing, objecteth nothing, it is as willing to a word of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> as to a word of Promiſe; to the <hi>Work,</hi> as to the <hi>Reward.</hi> It is all over yielding, and ſubmitting. Which is all that ſhall be ſaid here, to the Caſe propounded; becauſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be offer'd to ſpeak more fully to it ſhortly, in the amplification of this Point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. A ſecond Concluſion from this Promiſe is this, <hi>viz. That it is one and the ſame Hand which woundeth and healeth, which caſteth down and raiſeth up: Which brings into the Wilderneſs, and after ſpeaks unto the Heart. [I will allure, and I will ſpeak].</hi> As the ruſt of <hi>Achilles</hi> his Sword only, cured the Wounds which it made. Pſal. 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken Heart, and ſaveth ſuch as are of a contrite Spirit.</hi> He breaks the Veſſel, and then pours out the Oyl of Salvation into it. Hoſ. 6.1. <hi>He hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:205125:61"/> and he will bind us up.</hi> The Hand of God even when it ſtrikes, drops Balſam; his very Rods are bound up in Silk and ſoftneſs, and beforehand dipt in Balm. He wounds that he may heal, and in wounding healeth. What the Poet's Fable concerning <hi>Telephus</hi> his Spear, is here truly verified: <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na eadem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que manus vulnus opemque tulit.</hi> The ſame holy Hand that wounded us, muſt cure us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>So then it is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4. <hi>The Lord of all Comfort, who comforteth us in all our Tribulation.</hi> — Jeſus Chriſt brings the Soul into ſaving Trouble, and then ſheds abroad into the Heart the comforts of Sanctifying Grace: He is alway ready at hand, always good and kind to Man, but <hi>then</hi> eſpecially when Man ſtands in moſt need of him; as all the Saints have found and teſtified. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>Hagar</hi> in the Wilderneſs; <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions Den; and they in the fiery Furnace. <hi>Job, David, Hezekiah,</hi> in great diſtreſs and anguiſh of Spirit. When the Bottle is dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped under Water, he ſaveth it from drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The more grievous their Oppreſſion, the more gracious hath been his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And the reaſon hereof is good:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe none elſe can do it: Not Men or Angels, much leſs the Gilded Toys of the World, or all that exteriour Luſtre
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:205125:61"/> which charmeth the Eyes of ſo many, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a troubled Mind but as a Cloud in painting, a petty vapour of Water, or as Chaff driven of the Wind. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a ſaying common among them, <hi>viz. It is he that openeth our Heart in his Law, (i. e.)</hi> By his Spirit he enableth the Heart to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and effect Spiritual things; it is a branch of his Prerogative. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.45. <hi>He opened their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings;</hi> by removing Impediments, by breathing into them the Holy Ghoſt, and beſtowing further Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Graces: As S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounds and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that Text by ſome paſſages of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. God toucheth the Heart, as the Muſician doth the ſtrings of his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it ſoundeth what he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath Undertaken and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it; by <hi>Himſelf</hi> to our Firſt Parents, and by his Prophets unto the Church in every Age ſucceſſively. It is the ſum and end of the New Covenant, to accept thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves, to raiſe up them that are caſt down, to inrich thoſe that are <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> and to ſpeak comfortably to thoſe, who will not be comforted any other way. He brings them into this <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> for this end, that he may ſpeak, and not ſpeak in vain unto them. Till then, commonly Man is like an untamed Heifer, or wild Aſſes Colt, that runs and revels here and there, that breaks all Bonds, and will hear no Advice: When
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:205125:62"/> Sin is diſcovered, and Conſcience awakened, one ſyllable of the Goſpel, one word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is as good News out of a far Country. In every natural Man there is a three-fold Bar, hindering the entrance of Spiritual Light and Life; <hi>Ignorance</hi> in the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> it is covered with Ignorance, as the Deep was at firſt with Darkneſs, there is a very <hi>Chaos: Hardneſs</hi> in the Heart, like that of <hi>Nabal</hi>'s, which became like a <hi>Stone;</hi> and a malitious <hi>pravity</hi> in the <hi>Will,</hi> which is like a noiſom Sepulchre; ſo that as ſuch, he can neither underſtand, receive, nor affect this Supernatural Work, till the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved them by his Spirit, Cooperating with the Law and Goſpel. It is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that <hi>the Lord opened her Heart, i. e.</hi> effectually called her, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith: He gave her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light and Grace; without which ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Concurrence of his, <hi>Paul</hi>'s labour had been fruitleſs. In effect, it is all one with this, I <hi>will ſpeak unto her Heart, (i. e.)</hi> I will ſpeak Friendly, Plainly, and Effectually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conceive this Evangelical Work to go on in this Order;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Lord revealeth himſelf to ſuch a Heart, ſo dejected and troubled, as a Wiſe and Loving Father, not willing nor ſuffering any ſuch to periſh: As St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> told <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, Filius, tantaram lachrimarum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A Son</hi> of ſo many Tears (as ſhe ſhed for her <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) cannot periſh. Now theſe brought
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:205125:62"/> by a Voice into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> are all Sons of Sorrow, many Tears are ſhed by them (as a living Fountain ſends forth plentiful Streams) and often many Tears are ſhed for them, therefore they cannot Periſh. And this the Lord doth in three degrees.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He makes it evident, that there is a poſſibility of Eaſe, Purity, and Peace: And to that end, he brings many preſidents to their Mind, of old, hard, ruſty Hearts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, ſoftned and opened: For they are recorded in Scriptures for that purpoſe. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he <hi>obtained Mercy for this cauſe,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16. <hi>For a pattern to them which ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after believe.</hi> The Lord ſpeaks to <hi>ſome</hi> as bad as might be; compared to <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi> Iſa. 1.9. Yet in the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> there is, <hi>Come let us reaſon together, though your ſins be as Scarlet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Others</hi> are beſpatter'd with Idolatrous filthineſs; yet, <hi>I will cleanſe you from all your filthineſs,</hi> is God's Promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. Beſides many others with the Apoſtles black Roll, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed and ſanctified.</hi> Theſe and the like Inſtances are here brought to mind, as evidences of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Favour, and incouragements to Faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He diſcovereth Chriſt, and acquaints them with the New-Covenant, as the only Remedy, to make up the breach of the Firſt-conditions. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>my Son, a Lamb ſlain from the beginning, to take away
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:205125:63"/> the Sins of the World.</hi> Behold him in Union with your Nature, and in Unction to the Office of Mediatorſhip. Behold him in his Obedience, Active and Paſſive, aſſuming the Crime and Curſe of your Nature, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the penalty, and fulfilling the Precept of the Law in his own Perſon, but in your ſtead and room. Behold him in his Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Viatory Office, by way of Purchaſe and Conqueſt; as alſo in his Applicatory-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for all burdened Souls; who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are truly weary of Sin, <hi>behold</hi> the Mediator by a real tender of his own Merits, prevailing for you among the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He offereth Chriſt unto all ſuch, upon condition of Faith and Repentance, to the performance of which Condition he enableth in his Offer: So that they <hi>will</hi> to do, what they are required; ſaying often with grief and fear, O that we could Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve! O that we could take the Lord's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Although Actual Faith be not yet in the Heart, as ſome are of Opinion [tho Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> judgeth the contrary], yet it is very near, and ſhall infallibly follow. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> had her Eyes opened to ſee the Well, before ſhe went to it, and ſtooped down to take and taſte it. Faith comes in by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to manifeſt it ſelf by certain ſteps and degrees. And let all thoſe who find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves paſt any of them, thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God's Work, and be humbly conſtant
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:205125:63"/> in the uſe of Means, for the Lord will ſpeak again: <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it,</hi> &amp;c. And pray, as <hi>Luther</hi> wonted to do, <hi>Confirm, O Lord, in us what thou haſt wrought, and perfect the Work that thou haſt begun in us to thy Glory.</hi> As Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> prayed, <q rend="margQuotes">Look upon the Wounds of thine Hands, and diſpiſe not the Work of thine Hands; thou haſt written me down in the Book of Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thine own Hand, O read thine own Hand-writing, and ſave me!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> He openeth the Heart towards himſelf, and that in three Degrees:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He perſuadeth it of the truth of thoſe Paſſages formerly revealed and diſcovered, and that the Lord doth ſeriouſly intend them to all in this condition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He raiſeth up in it an earneſt longing after them, as the only good to be deſired, with which they may be happy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them they muſt be everlaſtingly miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The wiſe Spiritual Merchant, having once found this Treaſure, hideth it, and makes haſte for joy that there is ſome poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of enjoying it; he <hi>ſelleth all</hi> that he hath, and reſolveth to purchaſe it, whatever he pay, whatever the conditions be. As the hunted <hi>Hart</hi> longs after the running Stream; ſo theſe Men do now cry out, <hi>Give us Chriſt, or elſe we die!</hi> They Hear, Reade, Faſt, and Confer; O they will part with all, they will
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205125:64"/> do any thing for Chriſt: A Sight, a Touch, a Taſte of him is more worth than the World.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. After many Conflicts, Doubts, and Fears, the Heart is wrought upon, not only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive Chriſt, for ſo it was before, but actually to caſt it ſelf upon Chriſt, to reſt on him, and to reſign it ſelf wholly to his diſpoſe: [O the ſweet Repoſe which a fainting Soul finds in a Promiſe rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, after a ſtorm of Spiritual Trouble!] The Heart is ever with him, the Eye is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way upon him, and the Tongue is delighted often to mention him. Sweet Jeſus, haſt thou done and ſuffered ſo much for me? Was thy Heart pierced, was thy Head bowed, was thy Body nailed to the Croſs for <hi>my</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? How unworthy am I, ſuch a wretched Creature, ſuch a rebellious Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, ſuch an impure lump of Sin, to hear of ſuch Mercy, much more to taſte thereof? But ſeeing it was thy great Love to do it, and thy Bounty to prevent me by offering it, 'tis my duty to receive it, with all readineſs of Mind, and thankfulneſs of Heart: Tho thou ſhould'ſt kill me, yet will I truſt in thee; tho thou ſhould'ſt after caſt me into Hell, by me merited, yet would I come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: Lo, Lord Jeſus, lo, a dumb, deaf, and lame Leper before thee! if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean and whole; and if thou wilt not, (none elſe can do it) I reſolve to ſink at thy Feet, and if it were
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:205125:64"/> poſſible, to periſh in thine Arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Lord ſpeaks again to this ſame Heart, thus far wrought upon [three times he ſpake unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> before he knew what and to whom to anſwer], and the end and effect of it is three-fold:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the power of his Word, he turneth out the old Inhabitant, [for <hi>intus exiſtens probibet alienum</hi>] Satan, who did reign there by Sin, and brings another into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, even Chriſt, by his Spirit and Graces.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He changeth the natural Diſpoſition of the Heart, truly for Parts, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly for Degrees: There is no part but is beſpangled with Grace. As Air in reſpect of Light, ſo is the Heart in reſpect of Grace; of a double he makes one ſingle; a hard and ſtony Heart he <hi>ſofteneth:</hi> Underſtand not this of any Natural, Moral, or Legal yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (all which are preſuppoſed) but of an <hi>Evangelical</hi> ſoftneſs; a tenderneſs following upon ſerious deliberation and conſideration of God's infinite Love, Chriſt's bitter Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and the odious nature of Sin: And laſtly, Of an impure, deceitful, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Heart, he makes an honeſt, clean, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Heart. <hi>Ego non ſum ego;</hi> It is not what it was: Such power and healing Vertue there is in the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By his Divine Breath and Power, this Marriage between Chriſt and the Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate, the Spiritual Bond apprehended,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205125:65"/> and the Myſtical Union manifeſted; as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in this very Chapter; <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in Righteouſneſs, Judgment, Loving-kindneſs, and in Mercies: (i. e.)</hi> In him, in whom Mercy and Juſtice meet, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; I will do it truly and firmly, ſo that all his Benefits ſhall be made over by way of Joynture or Dower; thy Poverty and Deformity ſhall be accounted his, his Riches and Beauty thine. This is that the Lord ſpeaks to the Heart finally, for this he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> that he might win her to himſelf; and thus is this Work finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>The manner of Converſion, as for the preſent we apprehend it to be ordinary, thus far concluded, and briefly in the Heads only unfolded; we may for further ſatisfaction, light and benefit require.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. Firſt, <hi>When is the Lord ſaid to ſpeak unto the Heart?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, 1. When he overcomes the natural hardneſs of the Heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to let out that Spiritual Impoſtume, or maſs of Impurity, which lieth hid in every one by Nature. This is a Work to which neither Men or Angels are able to ſet their Hands. The Heart-maker is the only Heart-breaker; and he alone that knows the Heart can purifie or purge it. When Rocks are turn'd into ſtreams of Water, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:205125:65"/> melt like Wax, and clods of Earth are made like Stars of Heaven, ſurely then God putteth forth his Power; then he ſpeaketh to the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When he raiſeth any comfort in diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Minds, by cloſing with them in ſome promiſes of Pardon, or power over Sin: This is the Voice of God; for he only can prepare <hi>a Door of Hope</hi> in every <hi>Valley</hi> of Trouble, provide <hi>Manna in the Wilderneſs,</hi> Water in every dry Rock, and Light in every Dungeon. There is no precious Electuary for ſick Souls, but by his Preſcription and Adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When he anſwereth the deſire of the Heart, againſt ſuch and ſuch a Sin, or in a timely ſupply of ſuch a Grace, either in truth where it is not, or for degrees where it was in a little meaſure before. All Grace is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from Heaven, it <hi>comes from above,</hi> James 3.17. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> from God; the firſt and ſecond, preventing and aſſiſting. God bids the Soul to mortifie ſuch a Luſt, and the Soul complains, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.12. <hi>I have no might againſt this great Army;</hi> then the Lord comes in with Auxiliary Forces, and his <hi>Grace</hi> hath been <hi>ſufficient.</hi> God bids him to pray for ſuch a Mercy, and he finds himſelf very unfit; his Heart at firſt was dead and flat, but on a ſudden, he is carried above his own ſtrength, his Tears drop, his Love flames: God hath then ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:205125:66"/> then he came in with aſſiſting Grace. If the Heart burn in Prayer, God hath ſtruck the Fire; the Spirit hath been tuning the Heart, therefore it maketh ſweet melody.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When there is a cloſe concurrence, and an orderly ſubordination between God's Word and the Heart: When the Word is not only delivered to the Heart, but the Heart alſo is deliver'd up unto the Word. By the cloſing of theſe two, our Wills are wholly taken up in God's Will: So that the Heart ever ſaith after, as Chriſt did, <hi>not my Will,</hi> in any thing, <hi>but thy Will be done</hi> in all, O Lord! This is one reaſon alledged by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> why he would have all ſorts to reade the Scriptures, and frequently to hear them, <hi>Quia in illis loquitur Deus ad Cor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctorum atque doctorum:</hi> Becauſe therein God ſpeaks unto the Heart of the Learned and Unlearned. <hi>[Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Voluſ.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. Secondly, It may be further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>How a Man may know, when and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord hath, or doth ſpeak unto his Heart?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> By an awful dread, which fills the Heart when God hath ſpoken unto it. <hi>Joſiah</hi> trembled at the Voice of God in his Law: And that is a teſtimony of God's ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. But thus it is with every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that hears the Voice of God; <hi>the Devils tremble,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> quake; and as the Worms when it thundreth, wriggle into the corners
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:205125:66"/> of the Earth: ſo for all their lofty looks, though when all is quiet, they may puff up themſelves with a conceit they are more then ordinary; like <hi>Caligula,</hi> who thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a God, imitating <hi>Joves</hi> Thunder: But when the True God gave forth his Voice from Heaven, he that before was ſo high, was now as low in ſpirit, running under his Bed, or into any Bench-hole for preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So let the Lord but ariſe to ſpeak, the talleſt Cedar, the higheſt Tower, the loftieſt Spirit of Godleſs Men can dare it no longer, but will think the holes of the Rocks, and Caves of the Earth, to be their beſt ſhelter. Yea, even the inanimate Creatures ſhew the impreſſions of his powerful Voice. The Sea flies, the Mountains skip, the Earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, and the whole Creation ſhaketh at the Voice of God. Therefore,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be known by love and longing after him. As it was with <hi>Eliſha,</hi> after <hi>Elijah</hi> had ſaluted him, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inflamed, as if a ſpark of Fire had fallen down upon him, ſo that he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably follow him. Thou, O my Soul, art <hi>Eliſha,</hi> God is <hi>Elijah;</hi> if he once ſpeak unto thee, thou wilt follow him crying, <hi>My Lord, and my God! O lift up the light of thy Countenance upon me! When ſhall I come and appear before the preſence of God? All the days <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>f my appointed time will I wait.</hi> Such draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vertue is in the Word of Chriſt; it is as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:205125:67"/> an <hi>Ointment poured forth, therefore the Virgins love him.</hi> Love is the Whet-ſtone of Love; and the Love of Chriſt in ſpeaking to his People, conſtraineth them to love him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By thoſe Evangelical Effects for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned. When God ſpeaks unto a poor grieved Heart, as the Father unto his Prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Heart is raiſed to admire God in all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Ways, and is raviſht with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his Glory. <hi>What ſhall I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>nder,</hi> for ſo much undeſerved favour? <hi>I will take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord! I will dwell in the Houſe of the Lord, to behold the fair Beauty of the Lord for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By that ſpeedy reply which the Heart returns unto God, <hi>Speak on Lord, for thy Servant heareth, and thy Face will I ſeek,</hi> Pſal. 27.8. The Heart doth eccho out as it were an anſwer to the Voice of God; as <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. the Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Return ye Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Children, and I will heal your Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings:</hi> They readily anſwer, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art our God!</hi> Every graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon hath the duplicate of God's Law in his Heart, and is willingly caſt into the mould of his Word. When Men have their Ears only ſpoken unto in it, at the beſt they do but dwell on Duties, and place the ſum of their Religion in a bare outward profeſſion; but when God hath once ſpoken unto the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:205125:67"/> Heart, then they look more into the ſubſtance of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. Thirdly, If it be demanded, <hi>What a Man ſhould do, when the Lord hath, or doth ſpeak unto the Heart?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer; With all readineſs and humble reverence the Heart muſt ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord again. So much is expected, and good Manners will teach a Man ſo much; to ſpeak when he is ſpoken unto, eſpecially by ſuch a Superiour. Now, the language of the Heart conſiſts in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and Returning: In <hi>receiving</hi> what the Lord offers, by a flexible yielding unto the Work and Word of God; and by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence both of <hi>conſent</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and of <hi>obedience</hi> in regard of his <hi>Commands.</hi> In <hi>returning,</hi> Praiſe, Prayer, and all hearty ſervice: <hi>Praiſe,</hi> for that God is pleaſed to take notice of you, ſo mean, ſo vile. Great Men are thought to grace their Inferiours, if they vouchſafe to ſpeak unto them; I am ſure it is ſo here; by ſpeaking to us, the Lord doth exceedingly honour us: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſaith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> God's condeſcention is incomparable; he ſpeaks to his People, as a Man would ſpeak to his Friend; thus he graceth them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, outwardly, and ſo maketh them gracious and amiable in the Eyes of Men. <hi>Prayer,</hi> that as he hath begun, ſo he would finiſh the Work, till the Heart be throughly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:205125:68"/> moulded into a ſpiritual temper of Flexibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Purity, according to his own Heart.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. From hence the Erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Irregular Practices of all thoſe are juſtly to be taxed and reproved;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Who aſcribe this Work either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power and ſtrength of nature, or to ſome outward means, as if <hi>Man</hi> could ſpeak unto the Heart, or the matter of a Sacrament did contain to convey Grace by the work wrought. <hi>Pelagians,</hi> old and new, go the firſt way; <hi>Papiſts,</hi> with their followers, the latter way: Both joyning to derogate from the glory of his Grace, who aſcribeth this work unto himſelf; <hi>I will ſpeak unto the Heart.</hi> Theſe Men do undertake to ſail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Stars, and labour without the Sun. They ſet <hi>Dagon</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> equalize the Creature with the Creator. If this were true, then St. <hi>Paul</hi> miſtook to ſay, <hi>Not I, but the Grace of God in me;</hi> and, it is <hi>God that giveth the increaſe. Gratia non eſt gratia ullo modo, niſi ſit gratuita omni modo,</hi> is St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> rule. Let them with their Wit and Learning, endeavour to ſet up the Idol of <hi>Free-will,</hi> and ſtrength of Nature; let us with the ſacred Scriptures, labour to ſet up the Free-Grace of God, who <hi>worketh in us both to will and to do, of his own good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who being in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:205125:68"/> Spiritual Diſtreſs, will not ſtay till the Lord ſpeak unto them, but make haſte to drink Water out of any Puddle, to ſnap up Carnal Eaſe, from Worldly Jollity, in Eating, Drinking, Gaming, and other Paſtimes, to drive away ſuch Melancholy Dumps: Some by buſie Imployments, as <hi>Cain</hi> thought to do: Others by Muſick, as <hi>Saul;</hi> a third ſort by variety of Fleſh-pleaſing-Company: [Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein not much unlike to many weak and craſie Patients, that are ready to fancy any new Medicine they hear of, and to tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with that, rather than to expect a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, through a courſe of Phyſick preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Phyſician]: All which, you may be ſure, will ſay as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did to <hi>Judas, What is that to us, ſee thou to it:</hi> Either they will caſt you off deſperately; ſaying, Now you are mad, this you have got by reading and hearing ſo many Sermons; or elſe, they will ſlight it with <hi>Gallio,</hi> and care <hi>for none of theſe things:</hi> Or at leaſt they will quench all [a killing pity too common], by daubing with untempered Mortar: So that one day you will ſay out of woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <hi>Miſerable Comforters are ye all, Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of no value,</hi> good for nothing.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A third ſort to be blamed are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:205125:69"/> ſuch, as are converted outwardly in Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, [the Lord make them ſound!] Pictures without Life, <hi>Clouds without Water, Sodoms</hi> Apples, fair only to ſee to: The <hi>outward Man</hi> is ſpoken unto, and convinced ſo far as to perform Duties; the <hi>Ear</hi> is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto ſo far as to hear often; the <hi>Tongue</hi> is ſpoken unto ſo far as to diſcourſe well; but the <hi>Heart</hi> is not ſpoken unto; all the devotion of theſe Men is in Hearing and Cenſuring, they come to arraign the Miniſter at the Bar of their own Judgment, and to judge that Word, by which they muſt be judged at the laſt Day; they come to debate the <hi>Man,</hi> not the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to cenſure the Preacher, not to practiſe the Sermon: Like Merchant's Coopers, they taſte much Wine, but deal for none; their Hearts are not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; the ſame Luſts lodg there as before; reſtrained only; they are hard and impure as ever; the virtue of Chriſt's Death and Life is not yet applied to ſuch, they are yet deſtitute of Grace, whatever their profeſſion be: Nay, you and your Profeſſion are but like the <hi>curſed Fig-tree,</hi> that bare Leaves and no Fruit. God hath not ſpoken to your Hearts, neither did you ever ſpeak in your Hearts to God. Many Prayers you may haply ſay over, and yet never pray; for <hi>Prayer</hi> is an offering up of the <hi>Heart,</hi> or Will to God by Chriſt.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> will direct to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which concerneth either Miniſter or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Miniſters</hi> muſt learn to ſpeak unto the <hi>Heart,</hi> as near as poſſible they can; becauſe God doth ſo, whoſe Ambaſſadors they are. Like <hi>Marks-men,</hi> though they cannot ſhoot ſo as to ſtrike, yet they muſt aim at this Mark, their Arrows muſt be ſharpened for this purpoſe; though like the Arrows of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> ſome fall ſhort of, others go beſides the Mark, yet ſome or other being guided by a Supreme Power, may pierce the <hi>Hearts of the King's Enemies,</hi> whereby the People ſhall fall under him. Thoſe Miniſters ſpeak beſt, who ſtrive to profit more than to pleaſe; and ſo muſt all they that deſire to do good in that relation, they muſt preach to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to the Quick: As King <hi>James</hi> of famous Memory, ſaid of a Reverend Biſhop of this Land, <hi>This Man Preaches as if Death were at my Back:</hi> So ſhould every Miniſter do: Preach as if Death, Judgment, and Hell, were even at Mens Backs: Bring the point as near as may be, home to the hearers Door; that is, plainly, particularly, earneſtly; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they preach as a Man that ſhoots his Arrows at randon, and hits not the Mark; it is as if the Miniſter ſhould lay his Sermon on his Cuſhion, and never dart it into the Peoples Boſoms. If People do not feel your Points at their Backs, Spears in their Sides, and Swords in their Bellies, they will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:205125:70"/> feel nothing, it will be loſt labour. You that are <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Hearers,</hi> may learn,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To bring your <hi>Hearts</hi> with you to God's Ordinances: [How many heartleſs Sermons have ſome heard and made!] Elſe you bring nothing for God to ſpeak unto; and it is no more than if you ſent your Clothes ſtuft with Straw: Yea, upon the matter you deny his Preſence and Office. Men that are his Meſſengers ſpeak unto the Ears, and preſent things from their Lord unto the Eyes of the Body, and thoſe parts you leave not at Home; for what ſhould we do at Church (you will ſay) without our Ears and Eyes? But I ſay, What make you there without your <hi>Hearts?</hi> God is there who ſpeaks unto the <hi>Heart,</hi> as Men unto the <hi>Ear:</hi> If <hi>that</hi> be away, it is all one as if you were abſent: Nay, you aggravate your Sin, and provoke him more by your heartleſs preſence; in preferring Men, whom you vouchſafe to hear, unto God, whom you will not hear; but highly diſhonour him, by offering a dead Carkaſs in his Temple, an unreaſonable ſervice, in ſuch cold Devotion: All ſuch are Abominable; they put a Cheat upon God, and mock the moſt High: They come full Mouth'd, but empty Hearted; offer a Caſe without the Jewel, a Gilded Cup and no Wine in it. To ſuch God will ſay, <hi>Who required theſe things at your hands, thus to tread my Courts?</hi> My Sons, <hi>give me your

Joyn with the Congregation Hand and Heart, offer them both to God in earneſt Prayer, and attentive Hearing; wait and ſay, When Lord, <hi>how long, Holy, and True!</hi> Accept what thou calleſt for, and ſpeak one word to my poor <hi>Heart</hi> among the reſt, before I go, that the Bones which thou haſt broken, may rejoyce.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To labour moſt about the <hi>Heart;</hi> the Heart in the Body, and the heart of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; yea, and to prize good Men [who by their good Fruits, teſtifie to others the goodneſs of their Hearts, as the good Fruit doth the good Tree]; becauſe the Lord hath ſpoken to them. No Relick compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, no image can be a more lively remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer.

Who can reade, or ſeriouſly think of this myſtery of Mercy, without a readier expreſſion of joy mixt with tears, than their conceits in words? What a Man, a ſinful Man, weltering in Blood, full of Sores and Ulcers, fitter to be loathed than loved; for ſuch a one, Poor, Blind, Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Naked, to be married to a Prince, ſuch a Prince, the Heir of Heaven and Earth? <hi>Who can believe our report?</hi> or believing it, not <hi>love</hi> ſuch an one? <hi>To whom will the Arm of the Lord reveal this,</hi> but to <hi>humbled</hi> Souls, that are meaneſt in their own apprehenſions?

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:205125:71"/> and Prodigality, and had been there ere this, had not God in Chriſt been more merciful to them, than they were careful about their own ſafety. If the King ſhould vouchſafe to ſpeak to a mean Perſon before many, what an honour would it be? what raviſhing thoughts would ariſe, and what applauſe would it procure? How much more ſhould it be ſo here, when <hi>the King of Kings</hi> ſpeaks, and that unto the Heart of a forlorn Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>comfortably?

So almoſt in every Book of that holy Volume, may be found ſuch Stars of Light, ſuch pieces of Treaſure, ſuch Bezar-ſtones, to keep ſick Souls from fainting under their Sins and Sorrows; Promiſes, wherein the Lord ſpeaks ſomething to the Hearts of believing Penitents to this effect; <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head.</hi> Whatſoever Chriſt did or ſuffered, was for you; by his ſatisfaction God is reconciled to you, all your Sins are pardoned, and your Souls ſhall be ſaved. This is to <hi>ſpeak to the Heart</hi> of a poor Sinner.

                     <p>But 'tis ſufficiently known, that thoſe to whom this Comfort belongs, are moſt ready to put it from them, as none of their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>GOd's Miniſters are commanded by the Voice of that Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to comfort, to ſpeak to the Lord's People, to comfort <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, that her Warfare is accompliſhed, and that her Iniquity is pardoned. In obedience to this Command, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to publiſh this Word in ſeaſon, for <hi>your</hi> Benefit, in the following <hi>plain</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and the plainer, becauſe ſuch a dreſs doth beſt become Divinity. Affected terms may pleaſe the Fancy, but will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feed the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; they Court, but not Comfort. In theſe Points, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is more than Reading. Both ways (all praiſe be to the Author of Grace!) you have learn'd how the Lord by degrees, allureth and draws Men and Women, out of the pleaſing Fields of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, into the Wilderneſs of Spiritual
<pb facs="tcp:205125:78"/> Trouble, that he might there ſpeak unto their Hearts, and work them to a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Temper; wherein afterwards he keeps them, partly by preſenting Sin to the Eye and Conſcience, as he did to <hi>David:</hi> Which you muſt know is not to ſink, nor drive them to Diſpair, but to nouriſh and increaſe in them, an hatred of <hi>Sin,</hi> and a longing love after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſeeing the one daily, to loath it; and feeling the want of the other, more to deſire him. It was an excellent Speech of that eminent Martyr, Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> who lifting up his Hands flaming with Fire (as his Heart did with Love and Zeal) cried aloud to the People out of the Fire,
<q>Chriſt, and none but Chriſt.</q>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:205125:86"/> to thoſe, whoſe Religious Friends do often end their Days in ſuch diſtreſs). For by coming ſo immediately from the ſight of ſuch an ugly Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct, to the <hi>Intuition</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> of ſuch Beauty as is in Chriſt, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is more beatifical: To paſs from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Sin, into the preſence of God, doth more raviſh the Soul with Coeleſtial Joy. God in Chriſt will excel in Beauty and Glory to that Man's Eye and Apprehenſion, who hath lately ſeen the ſinfulneſs of Sin. As the Sin is never more glorious, than when it breaks out of a black Cloud, ſo the Glory of Heaven will certainly be more admirable and lovely to thoſe, unto whom Sin hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared exceeding ſinful.</p>
                  <p>Now, if it paſs unſeen theſe two Days, and if it be not preſented to be ſeen and loathed in one of thoſe Hours, then it will be preſented at the <hi>Great-Day</hi> (which is emphatically called the Day of Diſcovery, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13.) in fulneſs of Horror, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Fury: When the Curtain ſhall be drawn aſide, and all the ſecrets of the World diſcovered, and every Man ſee the actions of his Life as upon a piece of Tapeſtry ſpread before his Eyes, appearing as ſo many Thorns and Venemous Beaſts; and no Mercy to be ſhewed, no Grace to be offer'd; when no Petitions will be received, nor any Voice heard, but, <hi>Go ye Curſed into everlaſting Fire:</hi> As may be gather'd from divers paſſages of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:205125:86"/> ſacred Scripture, <hi>viz. Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23, 25, 41. <hi>Hodie, hodie poenitentiae locus,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> To day there is room for Repentance; you muſt repent <hi>now,</hi> or periſh then. If the Tap be not now thaw'd, it may be frozen for ever. Hell vomiteth up our higheſt deſires, and will afford no felicities. Happy is he whoſe Sins are ever before him <hi>here</hi> in a grieved memory, they ſhall never be ſet before him <hi>there;</hi> if they vex thee <hi>now,</hi> as a loathed burden, they ſhall not torment thee <hi>then:</hi> The Sins which ye have ſeen to Day, <hi>ye ſhall ſee them again no more for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Grounds whereupon this truth reſteth, are ſuch as follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That inviolable dependency which all effects and concluſions have upon their own Cauſes and Principles whence they flow. Acts, Powers, and Habits, are unſeparable from the Perſon, as they are one from another. Every Agent is and ſhall be attended with its own Works; the <hi>Dead in the Lord are bleſſed, and their Works follow them. The Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Crib.</hi> Sin lieth at the Sinner's door, and will acknowledg no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſter. What is once done cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. No Power can recal it from being. Only a penitent ſight of Sin, may hide it from the ſight of Juſtice, and Mercy can recal it from being imputed. An act contracting Guilt, may paſs from a Perſon, and yet not redound upon the Perſon, by a ſupernatural inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:205125:87"/> of ſatisfying Merit. Chriſt muſt come between and ſtay his Courſe, or elſe Sin would not only be ſet <hi>before</hi> us, but even <hi>upon</hi> us in full Guilt and Weight, and that for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The nature of the Soul in her retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculties, is another Ground; whereby ſhe is neceſſarily enabled by reflexion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, to ſee and judg all her own paſt Actions. This is eſſential, and therefore it is, that ſuch Power and Impreſſions do remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparated, either to puniſh or chear them, by the remembrance of things paſt. To which you may adjoyn the office of Conſcience; which is to bear witneſs, and accuſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, according to Demerit. A guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, we uſe to ſay, (and more ſay, than ſome are aware of what they ſay) is as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Witneſſes. It will tell us all that we have done for many Years ago, and preſent us with all the Follies of our Youth. This is the Book wherein Men may read their own Hiſtory and Doom, both what they have done and what they have deſerved. There are two Rules; the one is God's Word, which pointeth out both Eſtates; and the other is every Man's Conſcience, which is privy to the frame and ſtanding of his Heart, and which of theſe Eſtates is his. As long then, as there is ſuch a Soul with us, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch admirable Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Memory, and Conſcience; ſo long will Sin be before us; if we once do
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:205125:87"/> evil, we ſhall hear of it ever after, till San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification be perfect, and Grace be crowned with Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Order of Divine Juſtice, requiring ſome proportion between the pleaſure taken in Sin, and the vexation for it after. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful it appeared in coming, but ugly and deformed in going: ſweet it was in the offer and act, but bitter in the cloſe; like Hony which is very ſweet, but begets moſt bitter Choller: Or as <hi>Claudius</hi> his Muſhrom, which was pleaſant but poyſonful. How much ſhe hath <hi>glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her,</hi> Rev. 18.7. As it ſhall appear hereafter with the <hi>Impenitents</hi> in Hell, ſuffering by way of <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> ſo it is here on Earth with <hi>Penitents,</hi> ſuffering by way of Correction. Intention of delight in the act of ſinning, is juſtly recompenſed with extenſion of continued Grief. It will vex you long, becauſe it did affect you much: Sin was before you, when it ſhould not, and now it muſt be before you, when you would not. Juſtice being refuſed in the firſt, will be heard in the latter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Ends</hi> of all this, wherefore a ſingle Commiſſion is followed with frequent Preſentations, we may conceive to be ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To keep the Heart of God's People in a ſpiritual frame of Self-denial and Humility, and that the habitual grace of Repentance
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:205125:88"/> may be upheld, and more lively in exerciſe. Hereupon I am apt to think that Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> (that induſtrious preſerver of the Honour of many of God's Servants) was obſerved to ſay, <hi>That nothing did him more hurt than his Graces, nothing more good than his Sins,</hi> being <hi>ever before</hi> him. His Graces through the prevailing power of Corruption remaining, were ready to puff him up, and to ſet him in God's room, by ſelf-ſeeking: whilſt his Sins kept him down, and kept him humble and meek. Few know the benefit of this Combat: It is one of the beſt remedies againſt ſpiritual Pride and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, to keep the Mind upon Sin, and Sin in the Mind. Hence that confident ſpeech of renowned <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I dare be bold to ſay, that it is good for proud Perſons to fall into ſome Sin, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde ſibi diſpliceant, qui jam ſibi placendo ceciderunt. Salubrius enim</hi> Petrus <hi>diſplicuit quando flevit, quàm ſibi placuit quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do preſumpſit.</hi> Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. 14. That they may be humbled as <hi>Peter</hi> was, and ſo ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To terrifie his Adverſaries, and ſo to leave them inexcuſable, when the full weight of Sin falls upon them. If the memory of Sin do ſo follow them which have repented and are pardoned, how will it be with the Impenitent? And what ſhall be the end of thoſe <hi>who obey not the Goſpel? Cain</hi> had his Sin preſented in the Morning, and <hi>Judas</hi> in the evening of his Day; to aſſure all Men,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:205125:88"/> that they are ſure to hear of Sin again, either ſooner or later.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is to admoniſh all ſorts to be Wiſe and Watchful, leſt Sin deceive them. It cometh masked, and goeth away ſmoothly, as if it would never return; and ſay, it were ſo minded indeed; yet Juſtice will recal it, and cauſe it to be unvail'd, at ſuch a time, when you ſhall have beſt leiſure to attend it and look upon it. As it is with a Serjeant, who hath a Warrant to Arreſt a Debtor, but ſeeing him in the company of many of his Friends, who are to ſtand up for him, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by, as if he ſaw him not, or meant no ſuch matter againſt him; till after, winding about, he meets him alone and carrieth him away. So it is here. Sin hath authority <hi>(the ſtrength of Sin is the Law)</hi> to attach eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but ſeeing them in the height of Carnal Content and Jollity, Eating, Drinking, Playing, and fearing nothing; while they are in ſuch delightful and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Company, nothing is done; Sin is not ſeen, Conſcience is not diſcharged, all is at reſt and quiet; till after ſome time, they are found alone, withdrawn from their wild Companions, into a Sick-bed, or before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, then Sin comes ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and irreſiſtably, like the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> upon <hi>Sampſon;</hi> then account muſt be given of old Scores, and every one muſt bear his own
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:205125:89"/> burden, there is no way to eſcape, no Bail to be taken.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We may conceive it is to perfect Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and to prevent the dangerous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Enemies from without. Satan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the World allureth, Company entice, and bad examples would draw us powerfully after them, did not this Image paſt, terrifie and withhold us by continual Alarms. <hi>Take heed, and yield not for your lives; remember my Wormwood and my Gall; and, like the burnt Child, dread the fire,</hi> &amp;c. This, Sin doth not directly and by it ſelf, but <hi>accidentally,</hi> and as it is over-ruled and ordered by an higher Hand; <hi>occaſionally</hi> to humble and drive us out of our ſelves, that we may fetch daily more mortifying Virtue from Chriſt. Thus Light is brought out of Darkneſs, and Good extracted out of Evil.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this Point may be three-fold,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To inform the Judgment of two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. About the deceitfulneſs of Sin. It cometh at firſt pleaſantly, as <hi>Judeth</hi> to <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi> (dazling his Eyes with the ſplendor of Viſage, and charming his Ear with the ſweetneſs of Diſcourſe) clad with ſmiling circumſtances of Pleaſure, Profit, and much Content, and after it ſeems to go away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as if it would never return: And may be reſembled not unfitly to a certain Serpent that hath a ſhining Skin and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:205125:89"/> ſmell, but is a Serpent ſtill, and makes uſe of both only to enſnare and kill: Or to the <hi>Indian</hi> Beaſt, which hath the Face of a <hi>Man,</hi> and the body of a <hi>Lion,</hi> who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits the ſound of <hi>Flutes</hi> to charm Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and then entraps and kills them with a tail of the <hi>Scorpion:</hi> Thus under the ſmiling brows of Sin, may be diſcovered an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſnares, who ſtrangle while they ſeem to embrace. The cup of Hony will end in Gall, even the gall of Aſps, <hi>Job</hi> 20.12, 13. Of which <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that it is their Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and to this Poiſon is Sin there compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for when an <hi>Aſp</hi> ſtingeth a Man, it hath a provoking faculty firſt to make him laugh, but then caſteth him into a ſleep, till the Poiſon by little and little gets to the Heart, after which it paineth him more than ever it delighted him; ſo doth Sin. It is a bitter ſweet. <hi>Bernard</hi> compareth it to the Itch, which firſt yieldeth pleaſure, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſmart. And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith. Many devour that on Earrh, which they muſt digeſt in Hell, where they ſhall have Puniſhment without Pity, Miſery without Mercy, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row without Succour, Torments without End. Thus as the Ancients that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to make Medals, cauſed the Faces of them to be quite different and contrary; on the one ſide they graved an <hi>Achilles,</hi> on the other they figured a <hi>Therſites;</hi> if on one ſide an <hi>Abſolon,</hi> on the other an <hi>Aeſop;</hi> if
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:205125:90"/> on one ſide a Roſe, on the other an Onion: The ſame may be obſerved in the Medal of Sin; if you look on the one ſide, you ſhall ſee a Figure infinitly charming, on the other an hideous Fury. When therefore thou art making a covenant with Sin, ſay, O Man, to thy Soul, as <hi>Boaz</hi> ſaid to his Kinſman, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4.4. <hi>What time thou buyeſt it, thou muſt have</hi> Ruth <hi>with it.</hi> So if thou wilt have the ſweet of Sin, thou muſt have the Curſe with it; and let thy Soul anſwer as he doth, No, <hi>I may not do it, I ſhall ſpoil a better Inheritance.</hi> Follow <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> advice, to look upon Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure going and not coming.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Principium dulce eſt, ſed finis amoris amarus:</l>
                     <l>Laeta venire Venus, triſtis abire ſolet.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>They leave Horror and Terror behind them. As the Head of the <hi>Polypus,</hi> which is ſweet to the Palat, but after cauſeth troubleſome Sleep, and frightful Dreams; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth. At preſent you only ſee the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not the torment of Sin. Look upon <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and they will tell thee what a Scorpion it will be in thy ſide one time or other: That with <hi>Orphean</hi> Ayrs, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Warbles,</hi> it will lead thee to the <hi>flames of Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. About the folly of Man to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Sin; either that God will forget it, or that they ſhall never ſee it again: Hence
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:205125:90"/> it is that there are ſo many flie and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Perſons in the World, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to carry all things in the Clouds and dark Contrivances, that think to dance in a Net, as we ſay, and not be ſeen; and are ſtill very deſperate Wretches, cloſe Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Cheaters, deſpiſers of that which is Good. Well, let them look to it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael, Reuben,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> Numb. 32.23. <hi>Be ſure your Sin will find you out.</hi> God is Juſtice and Memory it ſelf, he cannot forget, nor (things as they now ſtand) forgive without ſatisfaction made and applied. Man is the unhappy Parent of Sin, and muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg his own iſſue. As ſure then, as there is an ever-living God above, and an everlaſting Light within a Man, a Soul with retaining Faculties and reflecting Power, enobled with that branch of Eternity <hi>[Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,]</hi> ſo ſure will Sin return, and the Soul ſhall ſee and acknowledg her own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; either <hi>here</hi> to begin and continue Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical <hi>ſorrow,</hi> or <hi>hereafter,</hi> to beget and increaſe Infernal Horrors and Terrors inexpreſſible. It is great weakneſs to think otherwiſe. Believe thoſe that have had, and given experience of this Truth; who have felt the burden of Sin, and have been hunted with it from place to place, and could find no peace nor reſt a long time; and all becauſe Sin was <hi>ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:205125:91"/> them. Happy are thoſe who learn Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the harms of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The uſe hereof may tend to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> the Life, by reproving three ſorts of Misbelievers: Though, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid in one of his Books, concerning God's Government of the World, I ſuppoſe my Diſcourſe will be unwelcome to many, and that becauſe it is a ſmart and ſharp reprehenſion. Men love not the taſte of Wormwood, of Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. But the Diet, though not ſo tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, yet is wholeſome; this rebuke though not ſo pleaſing, yet is ſurely profitable, and eſpecially being ſeaſonable and ſuitable.</p>
                  <p>And, 1. It reproves ſuch as make a mock of Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Fools make a mock of Sin;</hi> and drink down Iniquity like Water, ſelling themſelves to work Wickedneſs, and ſo heaping up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. As if Sin were but a Trick of Youth, a Toy, a Vapour, a Bubble, to be ſeen to day, and never after; as if it were as ſoon paſt as done, and as ſhort-liv'd as the <hi>Ephemora,</hi> that lived but eight Hours, and were no more. How do ſuch ſwarm amongſt us? Have we not our <hi>Cains,</hi> that kill their Brethren with Envy and Anger? Our <hi>Nimrods,</hi> mighty and cunning Hunters, after the Souls, Bodies, and Eſtates of Men? Our <hi>Eſau's,</hi> that ſell their Birth-right, all their hope and right to Heaven, for Carnal Contentment? Our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan's,</hi> who commit Sacriledg, and ſteal
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:205125:91"/> Coals from the Altar, to burn up themſelves and Poſterity after them, by appropriating, or ſelling the conſecrated Portion? Our <hi>Ahab's,</hi> that covet their Neighbours <hi>Vinyards,</hi> their Places and Goods, to build up their own Houſes higher, though it be with Blood? Our <hi>Jezebel's,</hi> in many proud and flanting Minions, who miſpend their precious time in Spotting, Painting, Gaudy-dreſſing, as if they were meer lumps of Fleſh, or a Body without a Soul, having no other Deity but Pleaſure and Ambition, no Idol but their conceited Beauty? Have we not our ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Abſolon's,</hi> our Politick <hi>Achitophels,</hi> Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious <hi>Herods,</hi> whoſe natural inclinations proceed from them as flaſhing ſtreaks from a Cloud, to be inſtantly turned into Lightning: Many a Worldly <hi>Demas,</hi> who have no other God but <hi>Self</hi> to adore, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Elements, and mix Stars with the Duſt of the Earth, bring God to ſubmit to the Creature, whereby to attain the end of their exorbitant pretentions. And which is worſt of all, even in the Lord's Houſe there are found <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas, Gehazi</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> too many dark Lanterns, blind deceitful Guides, whoſe Feet caſt Dirt in their Mouths, and whoſe Lives are at <hi>Sanballat's</hi> Work, when the Doctrine is, or ſhould be at <hi>Nehemiah's,</hi> and make <hi>Hebrew</hi> of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, reading them backward in their Practice; whoſe <hi>Inconformity</hi> pulleth down
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:205125:92"/> more than they build? We know the end of theſe Men, and yet dare imitate them. <hi>Te miror Antoni, quorum ſacta imiteris, eorum exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non perhorreſcere,</hi> was the Orator's ſaying againſt <hi>Antonius;</hi> I wonder, <hi>Anthony,</hi> thou art not afraid of the end of thoſe Men, whoſe deeds thou doſt imitate. Time haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when ſuch ſhall feel, what they will not now believe: When they ſhall ſee nothing but Sin, hear nothing but Devils and yelling of damned Ghoſts; remember nothing but the vanity of Carnal Pleaſures paſt, and the eternity of preſent Wo. O Fools and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, will they then cry out, that we were, to forget God, hate Inſtruction, and imitate ſuch wild Wretches, knowing their end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, and ſo delightfully to imbrace this deceitful Harlot <hi>Sin,</hi> to our own Ruine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then it will be too late to complain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such, who, though they do not ſlight Sin in it ſelf, yet they are thus conceited of it, that it will never trouble them after Commiſſion. In the <hi>Act,</hi> they think the beſt and worſt is paſt. True it is, you your ſelves may make a ſhift to forget it, for a time to put it out of your fight; and your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours who once knew, may forget it for ever: But God and your own Conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finally; they may as ſoon ceaſe to be, as to forget to work according to their Nature. What is not now, may be hereafter. Men loſe not their right, becauſe they take not

If this be ſo, that <hi>Sin once committed will be often preſented,</hi> it prompts all, 1. To think thus of Sin; When you are tempted, remember this Text ſet before you here, or elſe you will think of it after to your pain. It is momentany and frothy that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth you in Sin, but it is eternal that will vex and torment you. To repent, is to take a bitter, though wholeſome Potion, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency is followed with Damnation. Say you purpoſe and do repent, yet your Sin will <hi>ever</hi> be before you, either to grieve and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, as it did <hi>David,</hi> or to allure you to the ſame again, as it did <hi>Auguſtin</hi> often.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:205125:94"/> was right in the Eyes of the Lord, <hi>ſave only in the matter of</hi> Uriah; That ſtuck in <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and ſhall in <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Not becauſe he had never committed other Sins, but becauſe none of the reſt were ſo ſcandalous, none ſo accented, none ſo burdenſome to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as theſe, being againſt ſo much Light, of Nature, of Scripture, and of Humane Laws; few Repenting, none without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and many falling into preſumption, or deſpair by them. Under the guilt of any of theſe, for the moſt part, Men feel either too much, or too little; either they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of ſight always, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſeared, the Heart hardened, and Men are paſt feeling, or elſe they are ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſtaring in the face of Conſcience, as it were with the eyes of many Devils. Think of this aforehand, and beware, 1. Of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> in whole, or in part; becauſe it is <hi>better never to know the way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> than to ſin againſt Knowledg. 2. Of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> becauſe Men are made after God's Image, and ſuch Blood crieth from the Earth, till it have hearing: So many drops of Blood, ſo many Tongues, and every drop a Voice to cry for Vengeance. <hi>Give them Blood to drink, for they are worthy,</hi> Rev. 16.6. And it is threatned, <hi>He that ſheddeth Man's Blood, by Man his Blood ſhall be ſhed,</hi> Gen. 9.6. 3. Of <hi>Adultery,</hi> becauſe it brings with it much guilt and great ſtain upon the Soul.

                     <hi>Hoc grande flagitium eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job</hi> 31.11. This is an hainous Crime; a Wickedneſs with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Fire that conſumeth to deſtruction. God will judg it, who ever be ſlack to puniſh it. Hear what the Scripture ſaith of this Sin, the hainouſneſs and danger thereof, as a motive to avoid it. Prov. 22.14. <hi>A Whore is a deep Ditch, and he that is abhorred of the Lord, ſhall fall therein. David</hi> moiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this deep Pit, and there might have ſtuck in the Mire, had not God drawn him out by a merciful Violence, and purged him with Hyſop from that abhorred filth. Prov. 6.32, 33. <hi>Who ſo committeth Adultery with a Woman, lacketh underſtanding; he that doth it, deſtroyeth his own Soul. A Wound and Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhall he get, and his Reproach ſhall not be wiped away.</hi> It is not therefore <hi>leve pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> a ſmall Sin, as the Pope's Canoniſts call it. Divine Juſtice doth not uſe to kill Flies with Beetles. Briefly, it is a Sin that hurts both Body and Soul, it hurts Men in Goods, in Name, Poſterity; and will be ever before them, to make them mourn and ſay, <hi>How have we hated Inſtruction, and our Hearts deſpiſed Reproof?</hi> And have not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Voice of our Teachers? O what length and depth of Comfort doth a Man loſe for a little Folly! not worth the name of Pleaſure, becauſe it is brutiſh; and brings many and heavy burdens indeed; a ſtain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul, rottenneſs into the Bones, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:205125:95"/> a blemiſh indelible on the Name. Who would purchaſe that at ſo dear a rate, which he may have for nothing? Or uſe Violence, where he may have leave and a bleſſing too? Run the way of Hell for that Pleaſure, which they may enjoy more fully in the right Path and Way of Heaven? This Men conſider not. Had <hi>David</hi> thought of the end, he would never have adventured on the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; had he thought of ever ſeeing Sin, he would have wiſhed he had never ſeen <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> or that his Eyes had gone alone and left his Heart at home; then they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have brought their Lord into ſuch a ſtraight. <hi>Remember David and all his troubles.</hi> His ſweet never countervailed his bitter Sawce. <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was a pleaſing Object for a time, but Sin is fearful and grievous for <hi>ever.</hi> Luſt wreſtleth till it bring forth Sin, but Sin groweth and laboureth till it bring forth Death. And although the Combat be healed, and the Wound healed, yet ſome Scars remain. A great deal of preventing Sorrow and wholſome Suffering, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone; reade it in <hi>David.</hi> The Child that was born unto him muſt die. <hi>Thamar</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, <hi>Ammon</hi> murdred, and he himſelf turned out of Houſe and Kingdom, by his own Son. <hi>(It is a bitter thing to ſin againſt the Lord.)</hi> He faſteth and prayeth, weepeth and ſigheth, ſaying often, or to this effect: <hi>O Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke me not in thine Anger, neither chaſten me

Return, O Lord, deliver my Soul; O ſave me for thy Mercy-ſake: I am weary with groaning, all the Night make I my Bed to ſwim; I water my Couch with my Tears; mine Eye is conſumed, becauſe of grief. How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy Face from me? My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my Roaring? O my God, I cry in the Day-time, but thou heareſt not, and in the Night-ſeaſon and am not ſilent: I am poured out like Water, and all my Bones are out of joynt, my Heart is like Wax, it is melted in the midſt of my Bowels: my ſtrength is dried up like a Pot ſheard, my Tongue cleaves to the roof of my Jaws: Have Mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; my Eye is conſumed with grief, yea, my Soul and my Belly: My Life is ſpent with grief, and my Years with ſighing; my ſtrength faileth becauſe of my Iniquities, and my Bones are conſumed: Make thy Face to ſhine upon thy Servant, ſave me for thy Mercy-ſake. Day and Night thy Hand is heavy upon me, my moiſture is turned into the drought of Summer. Bleſſed is he whoſe Sin is covered, and whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy Wrath, neither chaſten me in thine hot Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: For thine Arrows ſtick faſt in me, and

I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the Day long. My Loins are filled with a loathſome Diſeaſe; there is no ſoundneſs in my Fleſh. I am feeble, and ſore broken. My Heart panteth, my Strength faileth me; my groaning is not hid from thee: Yea, Lord, all my deſire is before thee. Have mercy upon me, O my God, according to thy loving Kindneſs; according to the multitude of thy tender Mercies, blot out my Tranſgreſſion, waſh me throughly from mine Iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin; for I acknowledg my Tranſgreſſions, and my Sin is ever before me: Purge me with Hſſyop, and I ſhall be clean; waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter than Snow. Make me to hear the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, that the Bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce. Hide thy Face from my Sins, and blot out all mine Iniquities; create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me. Caſt me not away from thy Preſence, take not thy Holy Spirit from me. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit: Then will I teach Tranſgreſſors thy Ways, and Sinners ſhall be converted unto thee.

                  <p>Stay now, and look back and ſay, Is not this a great Mourning? Was not <hi>David</hi> in deep diſtreſs? How many ways doth he take? What words doth he uſe? Do not you ſee a Penitent exceedingly humbled, a Heart bleeding, a ſad and disfigured Face, a Body made thin, Sighings redoubled one upon another? Here are Joints pined away with ſadneſs; here is a fixed love of Tears; the joyous Harp hangs up, and knows no more what Songs of Triumph mean; he is wholly employed in expreſſing Griefs. He dies to all Mortal things of the Earth, and being caſt upon the Sea of Repentance, he makes it to eccho with Groanings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſwell with his Weepings. And all to deſcribe his condition by the preſence of his Sins, and excite the Divine Compaſſion towards him. And if <hi>David,</hi> penitent <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> was thus purſued with the thoughts and ſight of Sin, if <hi>he</hi> were ſent, and kept ſuch a ſtrong Beggar for Mercy all his days, for the matter of <hi>

And there are two Grounds of this truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is God's Order, which he obſerves in the Converſion of a Perſon, and Sanctification of our Natures, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Maladies, and ſetting Sin before the Eye of that Sinner, whoſe ſafety he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and intends. <hi>Partly,</hi> to ſtay him from running on further towards Hell; <hi>partly,</hi> to prepare him for the receipt and exerciſe of Regenerating Grace, and <hi>partly,</hi> to keep him humble, and weaned from an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate love of Worldly Glory, as from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſcourſe will more fully appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other Reaſon is, God's free Promiſes annext to the ſecond Covenant, and preſuppoſing this Condition. Only <hi>Faith</hi> is the condition of the Covenant, but this <hi>trouble of Mind</hi> is the condition and companion of Faith. As <hi>legally</hi> conſidered, it is a condition Preparative, and preceding
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:205125:99"/> Faith; as <hi>Evangelically,</hi> it is an unſeparable Companion ever following. <hi>Behold this ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing, that ye ſorrowed after a Godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 7.10, 11. <hi>Faith</hi> is in us firſt, in order of Nature at leaſt, though <hi>Godly ſorrow</hi> is apt firſt to appear; as ſap and life are firſt in the Root, yet Buds, Leaves and Fruits firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves in the Branches. <hi>They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced;</hi> there is <hi>Faith;</hi> for Chriſt crucified, can be beheld with no other Eye; <hi>and they ſhall mourn for him,</hi> &amp;c. Zech. 12.10. There is <hi>brokenneſs</hi> of Spirit, Spiritual <hi>trouble</hi> reſulting from it. It is an hard queſtion in Divinity, <hi>Whether Faith be no part of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi> Which ſome reſolve thus<note n="*" place="margin">Synopſ. purio. Theolog.

                     </note>: If Repentance (of which this Trouble is a branch) be conſider'd <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> for the whole work of Converſion, ſo <hi>Faith</hi> is compriſed in it; if <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> ſo it is the cauſe thereof: However, it is apparent they are nearly allied, they are Siſter-Graces; where the former is, there is the latter alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. To which, a <hi>third</hi> Ground may be added: When Man approacheth near unto God, he ſeeth both himſelf and Sin better: Sin appears to be greater, and himſelf leſſer: The Divine Light and Purity, repreſents both as they are in deed, and not as Satan's-Jeſuits (Pleaſure and Profit) do miſreport:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:205125:100"/> As it is with the Moon, the further off it is from the Sun, the greater it is; but by near approaching, it appears leſſer. It is St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s alluſion in one of his Epiſtles. Thus it is with Man in reſpect of God; <hi>Quò pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius ad Deum aceedit Homo, eò melius ſentit, quàm miſerae ſit, &amp; abjectae conditionis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Rivet;</hi> The nearer Man cometh to God, the better he ſeeth his own miſerable Condition: According to that of <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals, <hi>Quanto magis internae Divinitatis conſpiciunt omnes Sancti, tantò magis ſe nihil eſſe cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt:</hi> When the Saints by Faith come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Spiritual Myſteries, then they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee their own nothingneſs; that glorious Sun diſcovers all their Duſt; they are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their droppings, when they ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Ocean. As the great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who was immediately inſpired by the Holy Spirit, and of great Sanctity, no leſs then a Cherubim ſcorched with Celeſtial Ardours, and who pitched his Feet upon the front of the Sun, became moſt vile in his own Eyes, when he was carried up neareſt to God. Such poverty of Spirit, ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Mind, ſuch a ſight of Sin, is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſign of our Converſion to God, and of obtained Pardon.</p>
                  <p>Object. It may be objected, <hi>May not a Natural, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Man; ſuch as have no renewing Grace, have a ſight of Sin? May not they be troubled about Sin, and yet never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to, amend and procure Pardon?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doubtleſs they may not only ſee Sin with ſome trouble and diſtaſte, but alſo leave the exerciſe thereof; they may ſee Sin and be brought, I ſay, to ſome trouble about it, by the inward light of Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the uſe of outward means, while they live within the bounds of a Viſible Church; by the fear and force of Humane Laws, or by ſome heavy Judgment falling upon them in their Bodies and Eſtates; all, or any of which, may force open their Eyes to ſee, and acknowledg their own evil ways; as it fell out with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who ſighed at every Plague, and ſeemed to be willing to turn to God: And ſo did <hi>Ahab, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> Yea, they may go further, to leave ſome Sins, at leaſt for a time, as it is probable <hi>Herod</hi> did at St. <hi>John</hi>'s Preaching; and yet for all this, they may not repent Evangelically, ſo as to be grieved and throughly changed. But this is it we ſay; <hi>No Man in a ſtate of Nature can ſee Sin, and be troubled about it as</hi> David <hi>here was.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, David</hi>'s ſorrow proceeded from <hi>Love:</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:205125:101"/> When he conſidered, that God who had done ſo great things for him, was diſhonoured by him, and diſpleaſed with him; that his own Heart was made unfit for God's Service, and that the common Enemies were occaſioned to rejoyce and blaſpheme; then he burſt out into this ſupplicatory Confeſſion: This was the Fountain whence his penitential Tears did flow. But thus it is not with any meer graceleſs Perſon; his ſorrow for Sin is at the beſt from <hi>Fear,</hi> not from <hi>Love. Judas</hi> had an helliſh ſorrow, a deſperate grief for Sin; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was <hi>Evangelical. Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned.</hi> Lo, there lay the pinch of his grief, in that he had offended ſo good a God, that had maintained him, loved, delivered, crowned, and redeemed him: Oh, <hi>againſt thee, thee only!</hi> Such matchleſs Love, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Bowels, ſuch precious Blood of ſuch a Saviour. He is pricked with the Thorns of Chriſt's Crown, he bled over his bleeding Wounds, with the truly ſorrowful Soul, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven tares himſelf in pieces, for taring Chriſt's Side open.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was free, like Water out of a Spring. Fained, forced Grief is nothing worth<note n="*" place="margin">Virtus nolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium nulla eſt.</note>; it is like that of <hi>Judas,</hi> which was fired out of him, as ſweet Water is out of Roſes; and ſqueezed out of him, as Verjuice is out of Crabs: But gracious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are Volunteers in their ſorrow; which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:205125:101"/> we ſee practiſed by <hi>David,</hi> after he had num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the People, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>His Heart ſmote him, and</hi> David <hi>ſaid to the Lord, Take away the iniquity of thy Servant, for I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> And a ſhadow hereby we find in the example of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> General, who the next day after Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Triumph, went drooping and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his Head; and being asked why he did ſo? Anſwered, Yeſterday I found my ſelf too much elated with Vain glory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I correct my ſelf to day. But a better example we have of <hi>David,</hi> whoſe <hi>Heart ſmote him,</hi> as before. He was not ſmitten by God's Hand, or the Prophet's Reproof, as afterwards; yet his ſanctified Conſcience did its Office, that of a faithful Monitor; his Heart miſgave him. Bee-maſters tell us, thoſe are the beſt Hives that make the greateſt noiſe: Sure it is, that Heart is beſt, that ſuffers a Man not to ſleep in Sin. As for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Men, it is not ſo with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, David</hi> ſaw Sin, and was troubled about it, as it was Sin, ugly as Hell, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the holy and pure Nature of God, a defacer of his Image, and pleaſing only to the Devil, God's greateſt Enemy. But Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men, ſee and grieve for Sin, only as it is attended with pain, of loſs and ſenſe. <hi>Take away this Plague,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Scourge, not take away <hi>this hard Heart,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Plague</hi> of all. All trouble like
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:205125:102"/> 
                     <hi>Mercury</hi>'s Influence, is good only if joyned with a good, but bad if joyned with a bad Planet. The Object of ſorrow muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and that will ſhew the nature of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, David</hi> ſaw Sin with more hatred, indignation, and abomination than ever: It ſwell'd like a Toad in his Eyes; he ſpat it out of his Mouth with utmoſt abhorrency, reſolving to watch for ever after more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all his ways. <hi>I conſidered my ways</hi> (that they were not good) <hi>and turned my Feet unto thy Teſtimony; I have</hi> (now) <hi>hid thy Word in my Heart, that I may not ſin againſt thee. Turn away mine Eyes from beholding Vanity, and ſet a watch before the door of my Lips.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaw it, and theſe effects followed. So then, that ſight of Sin, which I account an infallible conſequent of renewing Grace, (that none may be miſtaken) is and muſt be timely, kindly, fully and conſtantly. <hi>Timely,</hi> while the Day of Grace laſteth; as <hi>Judas</hi> ſaw Sin when it was too late. <hi>Kindly</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, being led and kept in view thereof, by an inward light and power of Grace, fighting againſt Corruption, and thereby keeping it ſtill in Memory; elſe, Reprobates may and do often ſee their Sins here by force, driven to it by Judgments, caſting out their Sins, as Mariners do their Goods in a Storm, wiſhing for them again in a Calm. <hi>Fully</hi> it muſt be, both for Intention and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion; for the <hi>nature</hi> of it, it muſt be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:205125:102"/> hearty, and for the <hi>Object,</hi> it muſt be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. Greater and leſſer Sins, open and ſecret Evils, the ſins of Youth and riper Age; all muſt be bewailed, where one is ſeen, though all are not alike burdenſome; ſome wound and terrifie more than others, according as there was more or leſs delight in commiſſion. Adultery and Murther did flaſh moſt in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Face, bringing along with them into his mind and ſight, even his <hi>Birth-ſin.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was much troubled, for that he brake into an Orchard when he was a Boy; and for that he had ſtaied another time, delightfully to behold two Cocks fighting, and that but once: So much he teſtifies in his Confeſſions. And if ſo, how will they be troubled another day, who ſpend many Days, the moſt of their Time, in Hunting, Cock-fighting, Bull, or Bear-baiting, turning Recreation into Vocation? How will they be diſquieted with the ſight of Sin, who rob not only <hi>Orchards</hi> in their School-way, but <hi>Houſes,</hi> not of <hi>Men,</hi> but of <hi>God;</hi> as our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators</hi> and <hi>Simoniſts</hi> do; of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Malachy</hi> complains. The trouble of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould raiſe ſome trouble in their Minds, who are guilty in any kind. Sin will have Trouble. I have read of one, who was a Steward to ſome Gentleman, or a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to ſome Merchant, that was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, as for other Sins, ſo for one daſh with his Pen, which was done to wrong another.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:205125:103"/> The redounding guilt of a ſmall Act is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. Sin receiveth weight from the purity and juſtice of God, who forbids it inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely; not only great Sins, but all Sins. For if he arm but one Sin againſt us (which Men may deem little, if not <hi>Venial</hi>) that <hi>little</hi> one is enough to hunt and ſink a Man, as far as it is poſſible for a Creature to fall from God. And as it muſt be fully, ſo it muſt be <hi>conſtantly.</hi> This ſight of Sin, which is nothing but Evangelical Sorrow for Sin, following upon the Spiritual Combat and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed light of Conſcience, is not bounded but by Death: More or leſs it continueth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Life, and rather increaſeth than decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as Love doth. It is not ſufficient to ſee Sin once a Year, (and yet it would be better for ſome then it is, did they go ſo far) as our Adverſaries require <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> nor once in our Life, only at Death to caſt an eye upon it, and bid it adieu, with an O Lord, Lord be merciful, and open unto me, (which good words and ſeaſonable too, are not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but the delaying of ſo main a Duty till then): Heaven is not to be had uſually at ſo cheap a rate. Satan ordinarily is not ſo ſoon vanquiſhed, nor Sin ſo eaſily put off: Whoſoever thinks it ſo eaſie a matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, as that he hath ſeen and ſorrowed enough for Sin, now he may deſiſt from both, did never ſee nor ſorrow for it at all. What <hi>David</hi> here ſaid of himſelf, is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:205125:103"/> true of every renewed Heart, more or leſs, during Life, <q>My Sin is ever before me.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice, do place Sin rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ear of the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> than before the Eye of the <hi>Committer:</hi> That the one muſt hear it, is abſolutely neceſſary, without which, there is no Salvation, that the other ſhould ſee it, is not ſo; at leaſt not ſo much preſt by them. <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> is more inſiſted on, than <hi>inward Contrition:</hi> And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> is too far ſever'd by them from <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> We hear much and often of the one, but of the other there is too deep a ſilence. <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> are ſtrictly lookt unto, by ſuch as profeſs their Religion in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, (to give them their due, that nothing may be blamed in them, but what is blame-worthy). But <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> this perſonal ſight of Sin, and Evangelical ſorrow for it, are not ſo much urged, neither in their Writings nor Practice, for ought I can learn. However, I diſlike not <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> it is a Duty very comfortable and uſeful; the abuſe ſet aſide, I could wiſh it more frequent among us; but never uſed in publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of our common People; who deem the worſt of ſuch as are thus troubled; condemning <hi>raſh judgment</hi> in others, do yet paſs the bounds of <hi>Charity</hi> towards them: As if, poor Souls, they only were curſt of God, and hated of others, becauſe they are thus purſued by Sin, and baited by Satan, eſpecially if it be on their Sick-bed. Strange it is to hear them cry out upon profeſſion of Religion! as if <hi>Religion</hi> were the worſe for it, becauſe her followers are thus affrighted for their good. They will not profeſs Religion, no, not they, nor be tied to frequent the Church, to perform Duties in private, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch and ſuch are diſtracted by it; Sure they are out of their Wits, this Book-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath made them Mad, elſe they would never complain and cry out ſo, that their Sins <hi>are ever before them.</hi> Why, ſay they, are not we all Sinners, as well as they? and yet our Sins never trouble us: More is the pity, and greater is their Miſery.

                  <p>True it is, ſome Men may ſuperſtitiouſly endeavour to make the Way to Heave nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than indeed it is; but far more there are, who voluptuouſly endeavour to enlarge it, and make it more broad and eaſie, than God hath made it; without any ſuch ſight of Sin, or trouble about it; crying out, To what end ſerveth this waſte?

The ſecond Uſe may be, to ſhew, in what caſe they are, whoſe Sins are <hi>never</hi> before them. <hi>The Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe, and Wine are in their Feaſts, they lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Beds of Ivory, and ſtretch themſelves on their Couches; they eat the Lambs out of the Flock, and Calves out of the Stall, they chant to the ſound of the Viol, and drink their Wine in Bowls, they anoint themſelves with chief Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and caſt away Care: Riches, Pleaſure and Honour, with all the Gay-branches of Worldly-glory, are the pleaſing objects of their Eyes: They eat, drink, and are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, driving all Objects from their Minds, which may bring the leaſt diſguſt, and afford the Body all Pleaſures, which may preſerve

Such I mean to reprove in this Uſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As continue in any known Sin, after diſcovery, or, that ſufficient means for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Conviction, have been afforded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As are buſied in ſetting other Men's Sins before them, but not their own. Only Swine delight to be muzling in Dung; and Dogs, we know are pleaſed in licking Sores; Flies paſs over the ſound parts, and if there be any raw, they light on them; Beetles fly over ſweet Flowers, but creep into Dung: Such for condition are thoſe People who are always rubbing on their Neighbour's Sores, and ſearching the Wounds of others, whilſt their own do bleed to Death. Were it not for other Men's ſins, Sin would ſeldom be ſeen, or ſpoken of by ſuch; this ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the Sins of that, and that, the Sins of this Man: The <hi>Covetous</hi> Man ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him (as odious) the Sin of the <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi> and the <hi>Drunkard</hi> the Sin of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> Man, and <hi>both,</hi> the Sins of a third; but
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:205125:107"/> neither ſets before him his own Sins. One thing more which is worſe, Too many, as may be feared, eſteem a chief part of Religion to find faults abroad, and reproving others, eſpecially Superiours, who are further out of their power to redreſs, than from their Sight and Hearing; whereby it cometh to paſs, that much precious Time is loſt and miſpent, good Conference hindred, and Chriſtian Meetings fruſtrated of their main end. I ſpeak not this to ſhield common Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and National Abominations from juſt Cenſure; nor to debar Men from manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their diſlike of that, whereby God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, and Religion hindred; provided, Men have a Calling thereunto, and power with opportunity to do Good.</p>

Such as cannot endure a ſound plain-ſearching Miniſtry, no more than <hi>Ahab</hi> could endure <hi>Micah, Herodias</hi> a <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> or <hi>Feſtus</hi> a <hi>Paul:</hi> Like gaul'd Horſes, they cannot endure the rubbing of their Sores. Such blunt Fellows, ſay they, preach all of Righteouſneſs, of Temperance, and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come; we cannot have a <hi>Dalilah,</hi> nor an <hi>Herodias</hi> for them, they will ſet our <hi>Sins in order before us,</hi> as plainly and boldly, as ever <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>David</hi>'s, or <hi>Chryſoſtom Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia</hi>'s Luxury, and wanton Dancing. But this know, that if theſe kind of Men, Sound, Sober, Godly Divines I mean, be an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore to you, Sin was never <hi>before</hi> you, as a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:205125:107"/> Burden to you; nay, it was not ſo much as once in your ſight, except as an object ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured from the Senſe, either by diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diſtance, or diſtemperature of the <hi>Medium;</hi> and then upon ſuch a confuſed glimmering, your ſtudy and endeavour hath been, and is, either with <hi>Gehazi</hi> to deny it, or with <hi>Achan</hi> to hide it from the ſight of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> to extenuate it, or elſe to be angry with, if not to plot Revenge againſt ſuch as did preſent it; like the Serpent, which they ſay, the more he is ſtirr'd, the more he gathers up his Poiſon to ſpit at thoſe that move him; and ſo by degrees you labour to forget it: And how ſoon may a Man forget that, which he hath neither will, nor delight to remember? But in the Name of Chriſt, let me entreat all ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h to know and conſider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> How groſly the Devil deludes them, whilſt for a time, he hideth the ugly face of Sin from them, either with variety of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or ſome probability of deluding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as of Pleaſure, Content, and Secrecy; when as indeed, there ever followeth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bitter Diſcontent, and an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Concealment. As he did of old, ſo he doth ſtill, he ſhews the Honey, but hides the Gall, offers the Roſe, but covers the Pin in it. The Devil deals with Sinners, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Tradeſmen, who ſhew their Chapmen the better part of the Cloth, and conceal the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:205125:108"/> worſt: as the <hi>Panther</hi> deals with Beaſts, who hides his deformed Head, till his ſweet ſcent hath drawn them into his danger: Till Men have ſinned, Satan is a <hi>Paraſite;</hi> when they have ſinned, he is found a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> Like a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Hoſt, though he welcome us into the Inn with a ſmiling Countenance, yet he'l cut our Throats in the Bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> How far they are yet from the truth of Grace, that were never troubled with any ſight of Sin, or ſenſe of it. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row through <hi>fear,</hi> is a preparative for Grace. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> compares it to the Needle that draweth in the Thred; it is ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory by the bleſſing of God, of a <hi>more excellent Way.</hi> Sorrow for Sin through <hi>Love,</hi> is a conſequent of Grace. Strangers to both, are ſtrangers to Grace. They are yet in their Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> What an heavy Judgment this <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>benummed</hi> Conſcience is; it never ſeeth Sin, never grieves for Sin, never pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth Chriſt, but goeth on in Sin, day after day, without feeling weight, or fearing ſmart. A wild Beaſt while aſleep, ſeems very tame and gentle, but when awaked, it begins to ſhew it ſelf, by flying at the Face. Your Conſciences are now aſleep, but God will one day awake them, when they will never again afford you one day or hour of reſt. Though for a while you live in Mirth, ſwim in the ſweet waters of Pleaſures, and having
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:205125:108"/> deſpiſed the Immortal <hi>Manna,</hi> lay out all your care to ſtuff your Intrails with corruptible Meats, and Conſcience letteth you alone: Though you Feaſt to day, like <hi>Nabal,</hi> and make your ſelves glad, yet there is an <hi>Abigail,</hi> a Conſcience, which to Morrow will tell you of it, and then your Hearts will die within you, and be like Stones, as cold and as heavy as a Stone within you. This, O Sinner, like a Snake ſhall hiſs in thy Boſom, and bray thee like a Fool in a Morter, as it were with a Peſtel, and beat and diſtreſs thee for ever. This is the Moth that getteth into the Cloth and eateth it. <hi>When thou with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes do'ſt correct Man for Iniquity, thou makeſt his Beauty to conſume away, like as when a Moth fretteth a Garment.</hi> Pſal. 39.11. This will make thy Face gather blackneſs, and thy Spirit be overwhelm'd for evermore. This is unavoidable to all that live and continue in Sin, without a ſight and trouble for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Lord will one day ſet all their Sins in order before them, in their proper Colours, both for number and nature; Sins of Infancy, Youth, and riper Years; Sins of commiſſion, and careleſs omiſſion; eſpecially preſumptuous Sins, and thoſe of poſitive Infidelity, Impenitency, unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for Chriſt, and unfruitfulneſs under the Means; all theſe will come upon them all together, crying out, that all the World ſhall hear and know, <hi>we are yours, and you
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:205125:109"/> muſt own us;</hi> when there will be neither way to eſcape, nor time to plead. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, will conſider theſe things,</hi> and he ſhall <hi>underſtand</hi> to conclude it far better, to ſee Sin <hi>now</hi> than <hi>hereafter;</hi> now, while it may be pardoned, rather than hereafter when it muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What Comfort and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement may this Diſcourſe afford to all in <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe. They have ſinned grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, and their Sins are <hi>ever before</hi> them; <hi>now,</hi> not ſo much out of <hi>Fear,</hi> as out of <hi>Love,</hi> not by conſtraint but willingly. They may be aſſured, and ought to be perſwaded of their being in a ſtate of Grace; although many of them cannot quiet their Hearts to believe it. Their manner is, to frequent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Places, to be alone, to meditate of the Lord's Holineſs and Goodneſs, ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non reflecting with deteſtation upon their own actual Sins, and habitual Uncleanneſs; then they complain, ſigh, and cry, as if there were no hope of ſafety for them. What, ſay they, can ſuch as we be pardoned and ſaved? We, that have committed ſuch Sins, abuſed ſuch Mercies, and trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet ſuch great Salvation! We, that have ſuch hard Hearts, impure Natures, Eyes full of Adultery, every object yielding fewel to this Fire; and are daily followed with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſo many Sins! Whoſe thoughts by
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:205125:109"/> Day, and dreams by Night, are ſufficient evidences of a curſed diſpoſition? That can do nothing but Sin, Day nor Night? O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Caſe! O wretched Condition! <hi>Who ſhall deliver?</hi> Or, who can perſuade us that it is poſſible? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When indeed, this ſight of Sin, and trouble for it, is one ground of Hope, a mark of Grace, and a fruit of God's Love. Come therefore <hi>let us reaſon together;</hi> ſay the worſt againſt your ſelves, (for ſo I know you will) let all out; ſay, you ſee your Sins for Number innumerable, for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture heinous, and crying; and for Weight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, even to corporal Weakneſs, to Paleneſs and Fainting; accompanied with ſtrange Fears and Conſumptions of the Body (this is poſſible); ſay you feel the burden of unclean Hearts and Eyes (uſually they go together) daily and hourly; that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think without Sinning, nor look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Luſting, in ſudden motions ariſing from every Creature, any way capable of ſuch a Paſſion; no, nor ſleep without filthy Dreams, ſymptomes of an impure Heart: Say you are ready to ſink every moment, under fear of Deſpair, or Apoſtacy, by reaſon of the multitude and preſſing conſtancy of all the former: Was not <hi>David,</hi> a Man <hi>after God's own Heart,</hi> was not penitent <hi>David</hi> thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, purſued and troubled, after his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was obtained and aſſured to him? His Sin was <hi>ever before</hi> him, and yet he was then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:205125:110"/> in a ſtate of Grace. Be not diſcouraged; only be careful to tread in his Steps, and you ſhall find his Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How may we know whether we ſee our Sins ſavingly, as</hi> David <hi>did, or no?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By divers Marks it may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you ſee Sin in it ſelf, as it is Sin, and as abſtracted from Concomitants, <hi>viz.</hi> Shame, and Pain. If you loath it, and your ſelves for it, becauſe it is ſo oppoſite to the holy and pure Nature of God; and if the bent of your affection be againſt it, as the greateſt evil; that you deſire freedom from Sin above all other Boons; if you be weary of it, to fear and hate it more than the Devil, deſiring it may be apprehended and killed at every Sermon you hear; reſolving howſoever to leave all, whatever come: If it be thus with you in ſome good meaſure, it is a good ſign you ſee Sin aright.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you ſee Sin ſo, as that for it, you cannot ſee, to remember any of your weak performances of holy Duties, ſince your Converſion. <hi>This one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth to thoſe things which are before, I preſs to the Mark,</hi> ſaith bleſſed <hi>Paul. David</hi> faſted and prayed, ſacrificed and ſung <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſtood up for the Church, and relieved the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But none of theſe are now thought on to be mentioned, his Sin only is ever before him.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:205125:110"/> Our beſt Works in a ſtate of Grace, are ſo far from meriting, that ſometimes they will not come in to yield a Man any comfort in this Caſe; they are full of failings, impure and imperfect. There are more threds of Copper than of Gold, in the beſt Web we weave: <hi>Our very Righteouſneſs is as a ſilthy Garment:</hi> While Sin comes in full and perfect, and ſo weighs down the Scale; that our good Deeds are not in memory when Sin is before us: If it be ſo with you, it is another good ſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Sin be heavy to you, all other Croſſes and Troubles are light in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and more eaſily born. <hi>David</hi> was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly afflicted, by the rebellion of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and the death of <hi>Ammon,</hi> with the occaſion thereof; yet it is not ſaid, that theſe were before him, he was comforted concerning them; but his Sin <hi>was ever before him:</hi> All the Sufferings and Evils in the World could not ſo much affect him. St. <hi>Paul</hi> went through many Tribulations, endured great Sufferings (as may be read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24. at large) yet all theſe Scourges, Priſons, and Perſecutions, went not ſo near his Heart as <hi>Sin,</hi> even the <hi>preſence,</hi> though not the <hi>power</hi> of Sin. Though he ſuffered much, yet we reade not that ever he cried, Oh! for all; and yet he doth for Sin; <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Sin?</hi> And we reade of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> when he was
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:205125:111"/> threatned Baniſhment by <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> ſaid, Go tell her, <hi>Nil niſi peccatum timeo:</hi> I fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sin. To ſuch a one there is more evil in a drop of Corruption, than in a ſea of Affliction. Say then, are all your Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens nothing to the burden of Sin? It is a good ſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If you can think ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably of Death, and be content and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to Die, chiefly for this end to be freed from Sin, with thoſe combats and deſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Duty following it: That this <hi>ever</hi> may be turned into <hi>never;</hi> that Chriſt might be as Sin is <hi>now, ever before you:</hi> It is a very good ſign; and bleſſed are they which are in this condition: They may be aſſured in the Name of Chriſt Jeſus, and by the Authority committed to his Miniſters, to abſolve and heal <hi>Sin-ſick-ſouls,</hi> that all their Sins are done away by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt; they <hi>ſhall not die.</hi> He that cauſed your Sins to be ſet before your Face, hath caſt them behind his own Back. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſee their own Sins, the Lord ſeeth no Sin in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When the Church complains that ſhe is <hi>Black,</hi> the Lord proclaimeth her, the <hi>faireſt among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus would I comfort all thoſe who are in this Condition, that I my ſelf might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with them in their Conſolation. It is my judgment, all the Promiſes belong to them, and they ought to apply them. So
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:205125:111"/> that they may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>It is good to be here and build Tabernacles,</hi> to ſhield us from the roaring Lion, and our own Fears purſuing us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. To cloſe up all, in the laſt place, by way of <hi>Inſtruction:</hi> From what hath been ſaid, you may learn ſome Duties, moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be practiſed by you, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> To draw back Sin (which elſe will keep out of ſight and memory till the day of Death, or Judgment) as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Abner,</hi> to kill him, even all your Sins, for the kinds of them, ſpare none, from the firſt that was imputed, to the laſt that was committed by you, and ſet them <hi>in order before you,</hi> either by your Memory, or the help of a Note-book, ſo far forth as God ſhall enable you, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to recall, and give them their Deaths-wound, by the application of Chriſt's Death. It is conceived <hi>Job</hi> did ſo, when he ſaid, <hi>He could not anſwer for one of a thouſand.</hi> It is manifeſt in <hi>David,</hi> and reported of that holy Martyr, Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> that he kept a <hi>Diarie,</hi> or a Debt-book of Receipts and Expences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his own Soul. It is a courſe full of Comfort and Profit: Hereby it will come to paſs, that when a Man draweth nigh to his Journeys-end, he ſhall have nothing to do, but to give good Counſel, to pray and die. Now that you may ſo do, know this to be one main difference between Nature
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:205125:112"/> and Grace; the one ſeeth Sin <hi>ever,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeth it <hi>never,</hi> or to no purpoſe. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is ever boaſting of Innocency, of good Deeds, and of good aſſurance of Salvation without any doubting. <hi>O God, I thank thee, I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, Adulterers,</hi> or as this <hi>Publican: I faſt twice a Week,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 18.11. <hi>Non vulnera ſed munera oſtendit.</hi> He ſhews not his Want, but his Worth. While <hi>Grace,</hi> moſt complains of Sin, of defects and imperfections in the beſt Duties. Even the Righteouſneſs of gracious Souls, appears in their ſight, like the Moon full of ſpots. A penitent <hi>Publican</hi> dares not lift up his Eyes towards Heaven, but beats his Breaſt and crys, <hi>O God, be merciful to me, a Sinner!</hi> even the chief of Sinners. Though he is high in his Priviledges, yet how low is he in his Affections? <hi>Lord, I am Hell, thou art Heaven,</hi> ſaid that holy Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be thankful for this ſight of Sin, and teſtifie this your thankfulneſs by a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe of the Means, to finiſh what is begun. Means, I ſay, of Inſpection, Meditation, and Prayer. Of <hi>Inſpection</hi> into the Glaſs of the Law. This is that Light which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thoſe Corruptions which lie unknown in the darkneſs of Ignorance, and makes them appear in their due ſhape and proportion. That which ſeemed but as a Mote, will now be judged as a Mountain, and that to be Sin, which before look'd as Righteouſneſs. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:205125:112"/> you will ſee much to bemoan, to confeſs; and be aſhamed of, nothing to boaſt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in. Of <hi>Meditation</hi> after every Exerciſe; and therein be frequent and conſtant. Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hearing without Meditation, is like weak Phyſick which will not work. It is not taking in of Food, but the Stomach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting it, which makes it turn into Blood and Spirits; ſo it is not the taking in of any Truth at the Ear, but the meditating it (which is the concoction thereof in the Mind) makes it nouriſh. Be frequent in Meditation. Preſs your Conſcience with Particulars, ſaying with deep Sorrow, Theſe are my Oaths, my Carnal Sports, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Paſtimes, which now terrifie more than ever they delighted me: This is my Luxury, my Pride and Impurity: This is my Blindneſs and Hardneſs, Hypocriſy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Vain-glory, which is ſo much ſtruck at from Preſs and Pulpit: I am the Man, and my ſins are <hi>ever before me.</hi> Unto this effect let your Meditation be raiſed and continued. And laſtly, Uſe the exerciſe of frequent and fervent Prayer, in private to your offended God, that he would not only put away your Sins, but alſo waſh you throughly, and reſtore you the joy of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Be inſtant, and the Lord will not deny; <hi>You ſhall reap, if you faint not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Your duty is, to ſet the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor always before you at the ſame time. To
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:205125:113"/> ſee Sin without Chriſt, will drive you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; and to ſee Chriſt without Sin, may caſt you upon Preſumption; or at leaſt, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion you to undervalue Chriſt, and not prize him ſo highly as he deſerves. Labour to ſee both together. Set Sin on one hand, and Chriſt on the other, as a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet; as a <hi>King</hi> to rule you, as a <hi>Prophet</hi> to teach, and as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to ſacrifice and ſatisfie for you, and all yours under Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Then by an appropriating Act of Faith, receive and apply all his <hi>Doctrine</hi> to inform you, his <hi>Government</hi> to ſubdue and bring you unto Self denial; his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> to prevail for you; that his <hi>Obedience</hi> may be accepted for your Diſobedience, his Meritorious Sufferings for your Sins, and that with his <hi>ſtripes</hi> you may <hi>be healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But alas, I ſee my Sins ſo much and ſo often, that I cannot, I dare not, apply any Promiſe, I know not with what face to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, ſo abuſed, and even crucified by me!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True it is, and I believe a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may look upon his Sins in ſome Sence too much, and pore upon them too long, and ſo ſtand in his own light, become an hindrance to himſelf; eſpecially then, when he ſhall dwell upon Duties as if they were his Saviour, and hope for acceptance, by equalizing his Sorrow to his Sins; when he looks on them ſo, as that they deter and keep him from Chriſt. This is a fruit of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:205125:113"/> Self-pride, and followed with continual doubts and much unchearfulneſs. Whoever ſtudieth to be rich in Sorrow and Self-denial, before he will take Chriſt, doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God's Way and Method, nor rightly apprehend and prize the Treaſure offer'd in and by Chriſt. If you had no Sin, or if you had Victory over all, if you could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſh away all your filth with Tears, then you would believe; but then I tell you, you had no need of Chriſt. <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick.</hi> When you are moſt mean and vile in your own Eyes, when you are filthy and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſick unto Death, then you have moſt need of Chriſt, and moſt right unto him. Moſt <hi>need,</hi> I ſay, becauſe of <hi>danger:</hi> As it is with a weary Swimmer, who upon a Ship-wrack, being caſt into the Sea to ſhift for himſelf, is there toſt with Billows up and down, and almoſt drowned, till at length he eſpieth a Bough reached out to him from the Shore, which he readily and thankfully (without any ſcruples or doubts of his own unworthineſs to have ſuch a favour) laieth hold on, and is ſafe. Thus it is, and ſhould be with ſinful Man. For in truth this Swimmer is Man, caſt into the Ocean of Legal Fear and Trouble; Chriſt is <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> offer'd by the Father to every one that needeth, and will receive
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:205125:114"/> him. <hi>He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners,</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>to Repentance</hi> and Life. And as they have moſt <hi>need</hi> of him, ſo they have moſt <hi>right</hi> unto him, becauſe of the Covenant, wherein all the Promiſes are made over to ſuch. <hi>Come, let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and though your Sins were as Crimſon, or Scarlet, I will make them as white as Snow, or Wool.</hi> Iſa. 1.18. Yea, <hi>All ye that are weary and heavy-laden, come unto me, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>To him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt, I will give of the Water of Life freely.</hi> Rev. 21.6.</p>
                  <p>For, this ſight of Sin which is here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of, argueth Union by Faith and the Spirit, to be begun, and a reparation of Chriſt's Image in you, which by reflection cauſeth it; and then not to believe, not to receive him, not to give your ſelves to him, that you might reſt wholly upon him, is the greateſt Sin that ever you committed. Think not to leſſen, by increaſing your Sins. O add not this to all, and above all the reſt. Refuſe not ſo rich a Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are poor, mean, and deformed: If your Husband like to take you with all your Faults, as in earneſt he offereth, why will you ſtand againſt your own Preferment? If you be mean and low, he will raiſe and advance you; if you be poor, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich you; if you be deformed and loathſome
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:205125:114"/> to behold, he can and will beſtow Beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> upon you. Who will refuſe ſuch an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? that bringeth all things with him, and requires nothing but Poverty and Self-denial; a willingneſs to part with our own Rags, and to put on his new Robes. If you be filthy, he will waſh you in his own Blood, from the ſtain and guilt of Sin: If you be Naked, he will cloath you with his own Righteouſneſs, and ſeat you above Angels. Briefly, be willing to take Chriſt, and you ſhall want nothing. Give your ſelves to him freely, fully, deliberately, and he will prove a <hi>Jeſus</hi> to you, to ſave you from your Sins, which elſe will be ever before, and upon you in their full weight. Did Men know and weigh the Treaſure hid in him, called <hi>unſearchable Riches,</hi> there would be no need to perſuade any: They would take him more greedily, than ever the hunted Hart did the running Water.</p>
                  <p>And now, to all who have travelled through this <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of fear and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin, and are come even to the Borders of <hi>Canaan;</hi> in the Name of God the Father, I the moſt unworthy of all his Miniſters, do offer unto you <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> with all his Merits: take and apply them, for all are yours, you are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's. And thus I have
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:205125:115"/> brought you to the Fountain and Diſpenſer of true Happineſs, where I leave you, with the reſt of God's travelling Saints, to rejoyce in their Way, with Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe Sin is covered.</hi>
